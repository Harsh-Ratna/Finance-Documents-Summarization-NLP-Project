Exchange Rates
Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will af fect the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Indian
rupee price of our equity shares on the Indian stock exchanges and, as a result, will likely af fect the market price of our American Depositary
Shares, or ADSs, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and vice versa. Such fluctuations will also af fect the U.S. dollar conversion by our
depositary for the ADSs, J. P . Mor gan, or Depositary , of any cash dividends paid in Indian rupees on our equity shares represented by the
ADSs.
The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years indicated, information concerning the amount of Indian rupees for which one U.S.
dollar could be exchanged based on the certified foreign exchange rates published by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. The column

RISK F ACT ORS
This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could dif fer materially
from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in the following risk factors
and elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business.
Risks Related to our  Company and our  Industry
Our revenues and expenses ar e difficult to pr edict because they can fluctuate significantly given the natur e of the markets in
which we operate. This incr eases the likelihood that our  results could fall below the expectation of market analysts, which could cause
the market price of our  equity shar es and ADSs to decline.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated and may fluctuate in the future depending on a number of factors, including:
 
 • the size, complexity , timing, pricing terms and profitability of significant projects or product orders;
 
 • changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;
 
 • the proportion of services we perform at our clients’  sites rather than at our of fshore facilities;
 
 • seasonal changes that af fect the mix of services we provide to our clients or the relative proportion of services and product
revenue;
 
 • seasonal changes that af fect purchasing patterns among our consumers of desktops, notebooks, servers, communication devices
and other products;
 
 • unanticipated cancellations, contract terminations or deferral of projects or those occurring as a result of our clients reor ganizing
their operations;
 
 • the duration of tax holidays or exemptions and the availability of other Government of India incentives;
 
 • the ef fect of seasonal hiring patterns and the time we require to train and productively utilize our new employees;
 
 • unanticipated variations in the duration, size and scope of our projects, as well as changes in the corporate decision-making process
of our clients;
 
 • increased wage pressures in India and at other locations where we maintain operations;
 
 • currency exchange fluctuations; and
 
 • other economic and political factors.
A significant portion of our total operating expenses in our IT  Services and IT  Products businesses, particularly personnel and
facilities, are fixed in advance of any particular quarter . As a result, unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects may
cause significant variations in operating results in any particular quarter .
Therefore, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be
relied upon as indications of future performance. Thus, it is possible that in the future some of our periodic results of operations may be below
the expectations of public market analysts and investors, and the market price of our equity shares and ADSs could decline.
Our profits attributable to equity holders increased by 19.07% for the year ended March 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended
March 31, 2012. There continues to be a high level of global economic uncertainty driven by high levels of sovereign debt, particularly in
Europe. Pricing remains competitive and clients remain focused on cost reduction and capital conservation. Consequently , to maximize our
revenues, we are investing in developing capabilities in new technology areas and deepening our domain expertise. While we believe that we
have a flexible business model which can mitigate the negative impact of an uncertain or slow growing economy , we may not be able to
sustain historical levels of profitability . In our BPO business, we are diversifying our service of ferings to reduce the proportion of revenues
from customer interaction services. Continued attrition levels in our customer interaction services could adversely impact our operating
margins.
As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain our historic levels of profitability .

If we do not continue to impr ove our  administrative, operational and financial pr ocesses and systems to manage our  growth,
the value of our  shar eholders’  investment may be harmed.
Our expected growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources. This will require us to
continue to develop and improve our operational, financial and other internal controls, both in India and elsewhere. In particular , our continued
growth will increase the challenges involved in:
 
 • recruiting, training and retaining suf ficiently skilled technical, marketing and management personnel;
 
 • maintaining an ef fective internal control system and properly educating and training employees to mitigate the risk of individuals
engaging in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise exposing us to unacceptable business risks;
 
 • adhering to our high quality standards;
 
 • maintaining high levels of client satisfaction;
 
 • developing and improving our internal administrative infrastructure, particularly our financial, operational, communications and
other internal systems including data management in our IT  applications and Management Information Systems (MIS);
 
 • preserving our culture, values and entrepreneurial environment;
 
 • assimilating and integrating disparate IT  systems, personnel and employment practices, and operations of acquired companies; and
 
 • Managing our procurement, supply chain and vendor management processes.
If we are unable to manage our growth ef fectively , the quality of our services and products may decline, and our ability to attract
clients and skilled personnel may be negatively af fected. These factors in turn could negatively af fect the growth of our IT  business and harm
the value of our shareholders’  investment.
Intense competition in the market for  IT and IT eS services could adversely affect our  cost advantages, and, as a r esult,
decrease our  revenues.
The market for IT  services is highly competitive. Our competitors include software/IT  companies, systems consulting and integration
firms, other technology companies and client in-house information services departments. We may also face competition from IT  and IT eS
companies operating from emer ging low cost destinations such as China, the Philippines, Brazil, Romania and Poland. Some of our
competitors command significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources and generate greater revenue than we do. We cannot
be reasonably certain that we will be able to compete successfully against such competitors or that we will not lose our key employees or
clients to such competitors. Additionally , we believe that our ability to compete also depends in part on factors outside our control, such as the
availability of skilled resources, the price at which our competitors of fer comparable services and our competitors’  responsiveness to their
clients’  needs.
We may face difficulties in pr oviding end-to-end business solutions for  our clients that could cause clients to discontinue their
work with us, which in turn could harm our  business.
The increased breadth of our service of ferings may result in lar ger and more complex projects with our clients. This will require us to
establish closer relationships with our clients, develop a thorough understanding of their operations, and take higher commercial risks in our
contracts with such clients. Our ability to establish such relationships will depend on a number of factors, including the proficiency of our IT
professionals and our management personnel. Our failure to understand our client’ s requirements, the domain and country-specific laws and
regulations which govern the products and services that we provide, or our failure to deliver services which meet the requirements specified by
our clients could result in termination of client contracts and/or imposition of penalties or damages. Additionally , we may experience financial
losses in contracts which are linked to our client’ s future business outcomes or based on assumptions which are not realized. We may also be
subject to loss of clients due to dependencies on alliance partners or subcontractors.
Larger projects may involve multiple engagements or stages, and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for
subsequent stages or may cancel or delay subsequent planned engagements. These terminations, cancellations or delays may result from the
business or financial condition of our clients or the economy generally , as opposed to factors related to the quality of our services. Such
cancellations or delays make it dif ficult to plan for project resource requirements, and inaccuracies in such resource planning may have a
negative impact on our profitability .

Our success depends in large part upon the str ength of our  management team and other  highly skilled pr ofessionals. If we fail
to attract and r etain these personnel, our  business may be unable to gr ow and our  revenue could decline, which may decr ease the
value of our  shar eholders’  investment.
The continued ef forts of the senior members of our management team, including of our Chairman and Managing Director , are critical
to our success. Our ability to execute project engagements and to obtain new clients depends in lar ge part on our ability to attract, train,
motivate and retain highly skilled professionals, especially project managers, software engineers and other senior technical personnel. If we
cannot hire and retain additional qualified personnel, our ability to bid on and obtain new projects and to continue to expand our business will
be impaired and our revenue could decline. We believe that there is significant competition for professionals with the skills necessary to
perform the services we of fer. We may not be able to hire and retain enough skilled and experienced employees to replace those who leave.
Increasing competition for technology professionals in India may also impact our ability to retain personnel. Changes in government policies
may also af fect our ability to attract, hire and retain personnel. Additionally , we may not be able to reassign or retain our employees to keep
pace with continuing changes in technology , evolving standards and changing client preferences. Our profits could be adversely af fected if we
are unable to manage employee hiring and attrition to achieve a stable and ef ficient workforce structure.
Our profitability could suffer  if we ar e unable to impr ove our  cost management or  such strategies ar e not as successful as they
have been in the past.
Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on successful management of our costs. Our cost management
strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity , optimizing the costs of
service delivery and ef fectively leveraging our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. We have also taken actions to reduce
certain costs, and these initiatives include deriving greater productivity from fixed costs and relocating non-client-facing employees to lower -
cost locations. There is no guarantee that these, or other cost-management ef forts will be successful, that our ef ficiency will be enhanced, or
that we will achieve desired levels of profitability . Over time, we have seen a steady improvement in general and administrative costs as a
percentage of revenue. Because of the significant steps taken in the past to reduce such costs, we may not be able to maintain such a high level
of cost reduction once we have eliminated redundancies and streamlined our processes to maximize ef ficiency . If we are not able to mitigate
rising employee compensation costs by relocating to lower cost locations, passing such increases to customers, or using other measures, our
margins and results of operations could be materially adversely af fected.
Exchange rate fluctuations in various curr encies in which we do business could negatively impact our  revenue and operating
results.
Our IT  Services business is approximately 90% of our revenue from the IT  business. Our revenue from this business is derived from
transactions in foreign currencies, while a significant portion of our costs are in Indian rupees. The exchange rate between the rupee and
foreign currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the rupee against
foreign currencies can adversely af fect our revenue and competitive position, and can adversely impact our gross mar gins. Exchange rate
fluctuations have in the past adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our operating results. We generate approximately
42% of our IT  Services revenues in non-U.S. dollar currencies, and the exchange rate fluctuations between these currencies and the U.S. dollar
can af fect our revenues and growth, as expressed in U.S. dollar terms. We seek to minimize this risk by entering into forward exchange and
option contracts. However , volatility in exchange rate movement and/or sustained Indian rupee appreciation will negatively impact our
revenue and operating results.
A significant portion of our debt is in various foreign currencies. We also undertake hedging strategies to mitigate exposure of
exchange rate risk relating to foreign currency borrowing, including entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps. As mentioned above, the
exchange rate between the Indian rupee and foreign currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years and will likely continue to fluctuate
in the future. Volatility in exchange rate movement and/or Indian rupee depreciation may negatively impact our operating results.

Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to pr otect us against all potential losses to which we may be subject, and this
may have a material adverse effect on our  business.
Our insurance policies cover physical loss or damage to our property and equipment on a reinstatement basis arising from a number of
specified risks and certain consequential losses, including business interruption arising from the occurrence of an insured event under the
policies. Under our property and equipment policies, damages and losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as earthquakes, acts of
terrorism, floods and windstorms are also covered. We also maintains various other types of insurance, such as directors’  and of ficers’  liability
insurance, workmen’ s compensation insurance and marine insurance. We maintain insurance on property and equipment in amounts believed
to be consistent with industry practices, but we are not fully insured against all such risks. Notwithstanding the insurance coverage that we and
our subsidiaries carry , the occurrence of an event that causes losses in excess of the limits specified in our policies, or losses arising from
events not covered by insurance policies, could materially harm our financial condition and future operating results. We believe that the
insurance coverage that we maintain is reasonably adequate to cover all normal risks associated with our business, but there can be no
assurance that any claims filed, under our insurance policies will be honored fully or timely . Also, our financial condition may be af fected to
the extent we suf fer any loss or damage that is not covered by insurance or which exceeds our insurance coverage.
Our revenues ar e highly dependent on clients primarily located in the United States and Eur ope, as well as on clients
concentrated in certain industries, and economic slowdown or  factors that affect the economic health of the United States, Eur ope or
these industries may affect our  business.
We derive approximately 50% of our IT  Services revenue from the United States and 29% of our IT  Services revenue from Europe. If
the economy in the United States or Europe continues to weaken and conditions in the global financial market continue to deteriorate, pricing
for our services may become less attractive and our clients located in these geographies may reduce or postpone their technology spending
significantly . Reduction in spending on IT  services may lower the demand for our services and negatively af fect our revenues and profitability .
Some of the industries in which our clients are concentrated, such as the financial services industry or the ener gy and utilities industry ,
are, or may be, increasingly subject to governmental regulation and intervention. For instance, clients in the financial services sector have been
subject to increased regulation following the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the United
States. Increased regulation, changes in existing regulation or increased governmental intervention in the industries in which our clients
operate may adversely af fect the growth of their respective businesses and therefore negatively impact our revenues.
Furthermore, any significant decrease in the growth of the industries in which we focus, or a significant consolidation in any such
industry , may reduce the demand for our services and adversely af fect our revenue and profitability .
Our IT Services r evenue depends to a large extent on a small number  of clients, and our  revenue could decline if we lose a
major  client.
We currently derive, and believe that we will continue to derive, a significant portion of our IT  Services revenue from a limited
number of corporate clients. The loss of a major client or a significant reduction in the service performed for a major client could result in a
reduction of our revenue. Significant pricing or mar gin pressure exerted by our lar gest customers would also adversely af fect our operating
results. Our lar gest client accounted for 3%, 4% and 3% of our IT  Services revenue for the years ended March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013,
respectively . Our ten lar gest clients accounted for approximately 20% of our IT  Services revenue for the years ended March 31, 201 1 and 2012
and 22% for the year ended March 31, 2013. The volume of work we perform for specific clients may vary from year to year , particularly
since we typically are not the exclusive external technology service provider for these clients. Thus, any major client during one year may not
provide the same level of revenue in a subsequent year .
There are a number of factors other than our performance that could cause the loss of a client, and these factors are neither predictable
nor under our control. In certain cases, clients have reduced their spending on IT  services due to a challenging economic environment,
consequently reducing their volume of business with us. If we were to lose one of our major clients or have a significantly lower volume of
business with them, our revenue and profitability could be reduced. We cannot assure you that present or future lar ge customers will not
terminate their arrangements with us or significantly change, reduce or delay the amount of services ordered from us, any of which would
reduce our net sales and net income.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1123799/000119312513256124/d548270d20f.htm 15/167Table of Contents
Our results of operations may be affected by the rate of gr owth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of
technology spending by our  clients.
Our business depends, in part, upon continued reliance on the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients as
well as their customers and suppliers. In particular , the success of our new service of ferings requires continued demand for such services and
our ability to meet this demand in a cost-ef fective manner . In challenging economic environments, our clients may reduce or defer their
spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities and prospective clients may decide not to engage our services. Also, many
companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information, and they
may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel, processes and infrastructures. If the growth of
technology usage in business, or our clients’  spending on such technology declines, or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to
embrace new technological solutions, our results of operations could be adversely af fected.
Our profitability could suffer  if we ar e not able to maintain favorable utilization rates.
Our profitability and the cost of providing our services are af fected by the utilization rate of our professionals. If we are not able to
maintain appropriate utilization rates for our professionals, our profit mar gin and our profitability may suf fer. Our utilization rates are af fected
by a number of factors, including:
 
 • our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments and to hire and integrate new employees;
 
 • our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount in each of our geographies and
workforces;
 
 • our ability to manage attrition; and
 
 • our need to devote time and resources to training, professional development and other non-char geable activities.
Our revenue could also suf fer if we misjudge demand patterns and do not recruit suf ficient employees to satisfy demand. Employee
shortages could prevent us from completing our contractual commitments in a timely manner and cause us to pay penalties or lose contracts or
clients.
Consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our  business.
Companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other syner gies by combining with or acquiring
other companies. If two or more of our current clients mer ge or consolidate and combine their operations, it may decrease the overall amount
of work that we perform for these clients. If one of our current clients mer ges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider
for its consulting, systems integration, technology or outsourcing services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain
additional work. The increased market power of lar ger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us.
Restrictions on immigration in the U.S. may affect our  ability to compete for  and pr ovide services to clients in the U.S., which
could hamper  our growth and cause our  revenue to decline.
Our employees who work onsite at client facilities or at our facilities in the U.S. on temporary or extended assignments typically must
obtain visas. If U.S. immigration laws change and make it more dif ficult for us to obtain H-1B and L-1 visas for our employees, our ability to
compete for and provide services to our clients in the United States could be impaired. In response to past terrorist attacks in the United States,
the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has increased its level of scrutiny in reviewing visa applications and has decreased the number
of grants.
Additionally , the U.S. is currently considering comprehensive immigration reforms which may institute additional restrictions or
changes that could hamper our ability to service our customers, causing our revenue to decline. If those proposed provisions are signed into
law, they could have a substantial impact on our hiring practices or capacity to complete client projects, and our cost of doing business in the
United States could increase and that may discourage customers from seeking our services. This could have a material and adverse ef fect on
our business, revenues and operating results.
Although there is no limit to the number of new L-1 petitions, the L-1 and H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004 precludes foreign
companies from obtaining L-1 visas for employees with specialized knowledge if (1) such employees will be stationed primarily at the
worksite of another company in the U.S. and the employee will not be controlled and supervised by his employer , or (2) the placement is
essentially an arrangement to provide labor for hire rather than in connection with the employee’ s specialized knowledge.

In addition, companies which have obtained H-1B visas on behalf of employees face higher labor , legal and regulatory standards.
Investigations by the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor or unannounced random site inspections by the
United States Department of Homeland Security could also diminish our ability to compete for and provide services to our clients in the
United States.
Immigration laws in the United States and in other countries are subject to legislative changes, as well as to variations in the standards
of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions. It is dif ficult to predict the political and economic events that
could af fect immigration laws, or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or monitoring work visas for our technology
professionals.
Although we currently have suf ficient personnel with valid H-1B visas, we cannot be assured that we will continue to be able to
obtain any or a suf ficient number of H-1B visas for our onsite employees on the same timeframe as we currently maintain.
Our global operations expose us to numer ous and sometimes conflicting legal and r egulatory r equir ements, and violation of
these r egulations could harm our  business.
Since we provide services to clients throughout the world, we are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal requirements
on matters as diverse as import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tarif fs, taxation, sanctions, government af fairs, anti-
bribery , whistle blowing, internal and disclosure control obligations, data protection and privacy and labor relations. Gaps in our compliance
with these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines, penalties, criminal sanctions against us or our of ficers, disgor gement
of profits, prohibitions on doing business and adverse impact to our reputation. Gaps in compliance with these regulations in connection with
the performance of our obligations to our clients could also result in liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution,
unfavorable publicity , restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our
contractual obligations. Due to the varying degree of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws might
be insuf ficient to defend us and preserve our rights. We could also be subjected to risks to our reputation and regulatory action on account of
unethical acts by any of our employees, partners or other related individuals.
We have more than 25,000 employees located outside India. We are subject to risks relating to compliance with a variety of national
and local laws including multiple tax regimes, labor laws, and employee health, safety , wages and benefits laws. We may , from time to time,
be subject to litigation or administrative actions resulting from claims against us by current or former employees individually or as part of
class actions, including claims of wrongful terminations, discrimination, misclassification or other violations of labor law or other alleged
conduct. We may also, from time to time, be subject to litigation resulting from claims against us by third parties, including claims of breach
of non-compete and confidentiality provisions of our employees’  former employment agreements with such third parties. Our failure to
comply with applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse ef fect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
Our international operations subject us to risks inher ent in doing business on an international level that could harm our
operating r esults.
Currently , we have software development facilities in several countries around the world. The majority of our software development
facilities are located in India. As we continue to increase our presence outside India through our strategic development centers worldwide, we
are subject to additional risks related to our international expansion strategy , including risks related to complying with a wide variety of
national and local laws, restrictions on the import and export of certain technologies, data privacy and protection regulations and multiple and
possibly overlapping tax structures. In addition, we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience
with operations in such countries or with international operations in general. We may also face dif ficulties integrating new facilities in
different countries into our existing operations, as well as integrating employees that we hire in dif ferent countries into our existing corporate
culture. Our international expansion plans may not be successful, and we may not be able to compete ef fectively in other countries.
Legislation in certain countries in which we operate, including the United States, may r estrict companies in those countries
from outsour cing work.
Some countries and or ganizations have expressed concerns about a perceived connection between of fshore outsourcing and the loss of
jobs domestically . With high domestic unemployment levels and increasing political and media attention on the outsourcing of services
internationally by domestic corporations, there have been concerted ef forts to enact new legislation to restrict of fshore outsourcing or impose
restrictions on companies that outsource. Periodically , restrictive outsourcing legislation has been considered by federal and state legislatures
in the U.S. In the event any of these measures become law , our ability to do business in these jurisdictions could be adversely impacted, which
in turn could adversely af fect our revenues and operating profitability .

In addition, from time to time, negative experiences associated with of fshore outsourcing, such as theft and misappropriation of
sensitive client data has been publicized, including reports involving service providers in India. Our current or prospective clients may elect to
perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to of fshore service providers to avoid
harmful publicity or any negative perceptions that may be associated with using an of fshore service provider . Any slowdown or reversal of
existing industry trends towards of fshore outsourcing would seriously harm our ability to compete ef fectively with competitors that provide
services from within the countries in which our clients operate.
Our failur e to complete fixed-price, fixed-time frame contracts within the budget and on time may negatively affect our
profitability , which could decr ease the value of our  shar eholders’  investment.
We offer a portion of our services on a fixed-price, fixed-time frame basis, rather than on a time-and-materials basis. Although we use
specified software engineering processes and rely on our past project experience to reduce the risks associated with estimating, planning and
performing fixed-price or fixed-time frame projects, we bear the risk of cost overruns, completion delays and wage inflation in connection
with these projects. If we fail to accurately estimate the resources and time required for a project, future rates of wage inflation and currency
exchange rates, or if we fail to complete our contractual obligations within the contracted timeframe, our profitability may suf fer.
If our  pricing structur es do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of performing our  work, then our  contracts
could be unpr ofitable.
We negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions. Depending on the particular
contract, these include time-and-materials pricing, fixed-price arrangements, and hybrid contracts with features of both pricing models. We
also undertake element or transaction based pricing, which is done with a view of certain scale of operations. Our pricing is highly dependent
on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace, which might be based on limited data and could be
inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects, our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield
lower profit mar gins than anticipated. The risk is greatest when pricing our outsourcing contracts, as many of our outsourcing projects entail
the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations, utilizing workforces with dif ferent skill sets and competencies and
geographically-distributed service centers. Furthermore, when work gets outsourced we occasionally hire employees from our clients and
assume responsibility for one or more of our clients’  business processes. Our pricing, cost and profit mar gin estimates on outsourced work
frequently include anticipated long-term cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the
life of the outsourcing contract. There is a risk that we will under price our contracts, fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the
work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts. In particular , any increased or unexpected costs, or wide
fluctuations compared to our original estimates, delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings, or unexpected risks we encounter in
connection with the performance of this work, including those caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable
or unprofitable, which could have an adverse ef fect on our profit mar gin.
Disruptions in telecommunications could harm our  service model, which could r esult in a r eduction of our  revenue.
A significant element of our business strategy is to continue to leverage and expand our of fshore development centers at Bangalore,
Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Pune and other cities in India, as well as near -shore development centers outside of India. We believe that the
use of a strategically located network of software development centers will provide us with cost advantages, the ability to attract highly skilled
personnel from various regions of India and the world, the ability to service clients on a regional and global basis and the ability to provide
services to our clients 24 hours a day , seven days a week. Part of our service model is to maintain active voice and data communications
between our main of fices in Bangalore, our clients’  offices, and our software development and support facilities. Although we maintain
redundancy facilities and satellite communications links, any significant loss in our ability to transmit voice and data through satellite and
telephone communications could result in a disruption in business, thereby hindering our performance or our ability to complete client projects
on time. This, in turn, could lead to a reduction of our revenue.
We may be liable to our  clients for  damages caused by disclosur e of confidential information or  data security system failur es.
We often have access to or are required to collect and store confidential client and customer data. We face a number of threats to our
data centers and networks of unauthorized access, security breaches and other system disruptions. It is critical to our business that our
infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by customers to be secure. Despite our security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable
to attacks by hackers or other disruptive problems. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or
unapproved dissemination of confidential customer data could expose us, our customers or the individuals af fected to a risk of loss or misuse
of this information. We could be subject to termination of contracts for non-compliance with our client’ s Information Security policies and
procedures.

Many of our client agreements do not limit our potential liability for breaches of confidentiality . If any person, including any of our
employees or former employees, penetrates our network security or misappropriates sensitive data, we could be subject to significant liability
from our clients or from our clients’  customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws. Unauthorized disclosure of
sensitive or confidential client and customer data, whether through breach of our computer systems, systems failure, loss or theft of assets
containing confidential information or otherwise, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients.
We are investing substantial cash assets in new facilities and physical infrastructur es, and our  profitability could be r educed if
our business does not gr ow pr oportionately .
We have invested substantially in construction or expansion of software development facilities and physical infrastructure during
fiscal year 2013 in anticipation of growth in our business. The total amount of investment made to purchase property , plant and equipment in
fiscal year 2013 was Rs. 10,616 million (US$ 195 million). Additionally , as of March 31, 2013, we had contractual commitments of
approximately Rs. 1,259 million (US$ 23 million) related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our software development
and other facilities. We may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities and these expansions may increase our
fixed costs. If we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately , our profitability will be reduced.
Our business will suffer  if we fail to anticipate and develop new services and enhance existing services in order  to keep pace
with rapid changes in technology and the industries on which we focus.
The IT  services market is characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changing client preferences and
new product and service introductions. Our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate these advances and enhance our existing
offerings or develop new product and service of ferings to meet client needs. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these
advances on a timely basis, or , if we do respond, the services or technologies we develop may not be successful in the marketplace. We may
also be unsuccessful in stimulating customer demand for new and upgraded products, or seamlessly managing new product introductions or
transitions. Further , products, services or technologies that are developed by our competitors may render our services non-competitive or
obsolete. Our failure to address the demands of the rapidly evolving information technology environment, particularly with respect to cloud
computing and storage, mobility and applications and analytics, could have a material adverse ef fect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.
If flaws in design, function or maintenance of our services were to occur , we could experience a rate of failure that would result in
substantial repair , replacement or service costs and potential damage to our reputation. Continued improvement of our services and control of
quality , costs and product testing are critical factors in our future growth. There can be no assurance that our ef forts to monitor , develop,
modify and implement appropriate testing for errors and upgrading processes will be suf ficient to permit us to avoid an inability to provide
services or require substantial repair , replacement or service costs, any of which could have a material adverse ef fect on our business, results
of operations or financial condition.
Many of our  client contracts can be terminated without cause, with little or  no notice and without termination charges, which
could negatively impact our  revenue and pr ofitability .
Our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive, project-by-project basis. Many of our client contracts, including those that are on a
fixed-price, fixed-time frame basis, can be terminated with or without cause, with as little as 90 days’  notice and without termination-related
penalties. Additionally , most of our contracts with clients are typically limited to discrete projects without any commitment to a specific
volume of business or future work. Our business is dependent on the decisions and actions of our clients, and there are a number of factors that
might result in the termination of a project or the loss of a client that are outside of our control, including:
 
 • the business or financial condition of our clients or the economy generally;
 
 • a change in strategic priorities, resulting in a reduced level of IT  spending;
 
 • a demand for price reductions; and
 
 • a change in outsourcing strategy such as moving to client in-house IT  departments or to our competitors.

We may engage in futur e acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or  other  ventur es that may harm our  performance,
dilute our  shar eholders’  ownership and cause us to incur  debt or  assume contingent liabilities.
We have acquired and in the future may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or
products, or enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets. In the future, we may not identify suitable
acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates, we may not complete those transactions on
terms commercially acceptable to us. We could have dif ficulty in assimilating the personnel, operations, technology or software of the
acquired companies. In addition, the key personnel of an acquired company may decide not to work for us. We could also have dif ficulty in
integrating the acquired products, services or technologies into our operations. These dif ficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract
our management and employees and increase our expenses. Changes in competition laws in India and abroad could also impact our acquisition
plans by prohibiting potential transactions which would otherwise be beneficial for us.
Some of our  long-term client contracts contain benchmarking pr ovisions which, if trigger ed could r esult in lower  contractual
revenues and pr ofitability in the futur e.
As the size and complexity of our client engagements increase, our clients may require further benchmarking provisions in our
contracts with them. Benchmarking provisions allow a customer in certain circumstances to request a study prepared by an agreed upon third-
party comparing our pricing, performance and ef ficiency gains for delivered contract services against the comparable services of an agreed
upon list of other service providers. Based on the results of the benchmark study and depending on the reasons for any unfavorable variance,
we may be required to reduce our pricing for future services to be performed for the remainder of the contract term, which could have an
adverse impact on our revenues and profitability .
We may be liable to our  clients for  damages caused by system failur es, which could damage our  reputation and cause us to
lose customers.
Many of our contracts involve projects that are critical to the operations of our clients’  businesses and provide benefits to our clients
that may be dif ficult to quantify . Any failure in a client’ s system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our
responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to limit our contractual liability for consequential damages in rendering our services, we
cannot be assured that such limitations on liability will be enforceable in all cases, or that they will otherwise protect us from liability for
damages. A successful assertion of one or more lar ge claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or results in changes to
our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of a lar ge deductible or co-insurance requirement, could adversely af fect
our operating results. We may also be liable to our clients for damages or termination of contract if we are unable to address disruption in
services to our clients with adequate business continuity plans.
Clients may subject us to litigation to seek damages for  deficient services or  for violating intellectual pr operty rights.
Our clients may subject us to litigation and seek damages for losses caused by allegedly deficient services. Clients may also subject us
to litigation and seek damages for violating or misusing their intellectual property rights. Our inability to provide services at contractually-
agreed service levels or inability to prevent violation or misuse of the intellectual property of our clients could cause significant damage to our
reputation and adversely af fect our results of operations.
Softwar e licensors may subject us to litigation to seek damages for  violating intellectual pr operty rights.
Software licensors contracted by us for software licenses may subject us to litigation and seek damages for violating contractual
terms, misuse or excess use of our license to their intellectual property rights, which could cause significant damage to our reputation and
adversely af fect our results of operations.
Compliance with new and changing corporate governance and public disclosur e requir ements adds uncertainty to our
compliance policies and incr eases our  costs of compliance.
Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes
Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations, New York Stock Exchange rules, Securities and Exchange Board of India rules and Indian stock
market listing regulations, are creating uncertainty for companies like ours. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards may lack
specificity and are subject to varying interpretations. Their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by
regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a
result of ongoing revisions to such governance standards.
 
1910/14/23, 12:14 PM FORM 20-F

In particular , continuing compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our
required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial
resources. With respect to our Form 20-F for the year ended March 31, 2013, our management has performed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. We have determined that the internal controls are ef fective.
We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, and our ef forts to comply with
evolving laws, regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and
administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In
addition, the new laws, regulations and standards regarding corporate governance may make it more dif ficult for us to obtain director and
officer liability insurance. Further , our board members, chief executive of ficer and chief financial of ficer could face an increased risk of
personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may face dif ficulties attracting and retaining qualified
board members and executive of ficers, which could harm our business. If we fail to comply with new or changed laws or regulations and
standards dif fer, our business and reputation may be harmed.
If we fail to or  are unable to implement and maintain effective internal contr ols over  financial r eporting, the accuracy and
timeliness of our  financial r eporting may be adversely affected.
We are subject to reporting obligations under U.S. securities laws. The SEC, as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, has adopted rules requiring every public company to include a report of management on the ef fectiveness of such company’ s internal
control over financial reporting in its annual report. In addition, an independent registered public accounting firm must issue an attestation
report on the ef fectiveness of the company’ s internal control over financial reporting.
If we fail to maintain ef fective internal control over financial reporting in the future, we and our independent registered public
accounting firm may not be able to conclude that we have ef fective internal control over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level.
This could in turn result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. Furthermore, we have incurred and
anticipate that we will continue to incur considerable costs and use significant management time and other resources in an ef fort to comply
with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are not able to continue to meet the requirements of Section 404 in
a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange or
other regulatory authorities. Any such action could adversely af fect the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting.
We cannot pr edict the outcome of the Securities and Exchange Commission’ s voluntary r equests for  documents and
information, the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
As we previously disclosed in our Form 20-F for the year ended March 31, 2010, our Audit Committee and KPMG India conducted
an investigation into whether financial relationships, business transactions or loans existed between any members of KPMG India’ s audit
engagement team and Wipro as well as other potential independence matters, including whether any other members of the KPMG India audit
engagement team had dealings with any Wipro employees that would compromise KPMG India’ s independence from Wipro. KPMG India
concluded that it did not lack independence with respect to Wipro. Based on its review of the facts from KMPG India’ s investigation and
discussions with its external advisors, our Audit Committee concurred with KPMG India’ s conclusion.
Subsequently , the SEC’ s Division of Enforcement requested that we provide, on a voluntary basis, certain information and documents
concerning, among other things, issues relating to auditor independence. Some of the voluntary requests also relate to the same subject matter
we disclosed which the Audit Committee investigated previously , including the appropriateness of certain accounting entries pertaining to our
exchange rate fluctuation and outstanding liability accounts. We are cooperating with the SEC’ s requests. The outcome of the SEC’ s review of
this matter is uncertain. A conclusion by the SEC that dif fers with the conclusions reached by KPMG India and our Audit Committee could
have a material adverse ef fect on us.

If we ar e unable to collect our  receivables fr om or  invoice our  unbilled services to our  clients, our  results of operations and
cash flows could be adversely affected.
Our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed.
We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles. We maintain provisions against
receivables and unbilled services. Actual losses on client balances could dif fer from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might
need to adjust our provisions. There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic
conditions, such as a potential credit crisis in the global financial system, could also result in financial dif ficulties for our clients, including
limited access to the credit markets, insolvency or bankruptcy . Such conditions could cause clients to delay payment, request modifications of
their payment terms, or default on their payment obligations to us, all of which could increase our receivables balance. Timely collection of
fees for client services also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and subsequently bill for and collect our
contractual service fees. If we are unable to meet our contractual obligations, we might experience delays in the collection of or be unable to
collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely af fected. In addition, if we
experience an increase in the time required to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely af fected.
Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inher ent in the government contracting envir onment.
Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities. Our government work carries various risks inherent in
the government contracting process which may af fect our operating profitability . These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
 • Government entities often reserve the right to audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, and conduct inquiries and
investigations of our business practices with respect to our government contracts. If the client finds that the costs are not
reimbursable, then we will not be allowed to bill for them or the cost must be refunded to the client if it has already been paid to us.
Findings from an audit may also result in prospective adjustments of previously agreed upon rates for our work and may af fect our
future mar gins.
 
 • If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to
various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits,
suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. The
inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities, regardless of their adequacy and
therefore we can only mitigate, and not eliminate, this risk.
 
 • Government contracts, and the proceedings surrounding them, are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than
contracts with commercial clients. Negative publicity related to our government contracts, regardless of its accuracy , may further
damage our business by af fecting our ability to compete for new contracts among commercial and governmental entities.
 
 • Political and economic factors such as pending elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision
makers, revisions to governmental tax policies and reduced tax revenues can af fect the number and terms of new government
contracts signed.
 
 • Terms and conditions of government contracts tend to be more onerous and are often more dif ficult to negotiate than those for
commercial contracts.
 
 • Government contracts may not include a cap on direct or consequential damages, which could cause additional risk and expense in
these contracts.
We may incur  substantial costs for  envir onmental r egulation compliance.
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws relating to protection of the environment. We may incur substantial
fines, civil or criminal sanctions, or third-party claims for property damage or personal injury if we are held liable under environmental laws
and regulations. Our current compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse ef fect on our
financial position, results of operations or competitive position.
We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our  investment portfolio.
Deterioration of the credit as well as debt and capital markets due to economic turmoil could result in volatility of our investment
earnings and impairments to our investment portfolio, which could negatively impact our financial condition and reported income.

We are exposed to fluctuations in inter est rates for  our borr owings.
Turmoil in the financial markets can cause the borrowings rate to go up in the future. Deterioration in the interest rates could
negatively impact our financial condition and reported income.
Our financial condition and r esults of operations may be harmed if we do not successfully r educe market risks thr ough the
use of derivative financial instruments.
Since we conduct operations throughout the world, a substantial portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are
denominated in various currencies other than the Indian rupee. Because our financial statements are denominated in the India rupee,
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, especially the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee, could have a material impact on our reported
results.
We also experience other market risks, including changes in the interest rates of the securities that we own. We may use derivative
financial instruments to reduce certain of these risks. However , if our strategies to reduce market risks are not successful, our financial
condition and operating results may be harmed.
Management’ s use of estimates may affect our  income and financial position.
To comply with IFRS, management is required to make many judgments, estimates, and assumptions. The facts and circumstances on
which management bases these estimates and judgments, and management’ s judgment of the facts and circumstances, may change from time
to time, and this may result in significant changes in the estimates, with a negative impact on our assets or income. Current and future
accounting pronouncements and other financial reporting standards may adversely af fect the financial information we present. We regularly
monitor our compliance with all of the financial reporting standards that are applicable to us and any new pronouncements that are relevant to
us. Findings of our monitoring activity or new financial reporting standards may require us to change our internal accounting policies and to
alter our operational policy so that it reflects new or amended financial reporting standards. We cannot exclude the possibility that this may
have a material impact on our assets, income, or cash flows. For a summary of significant accounting policies, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements section.
An incr easing amount of goodwill and acquisition r elated intangibles in our  financials may lead to significant impairment
charges in the futur e.
The amount of goodwill and intangible assets in our consolidated financial statement has increased significantly in recent years,
primarily due to acquisitions. Goodwill and acquisition related indefinite life intangibles are subject to impairment review at least annually .
Impairment testing under IFRS may lead to impairment char ges in the future. Any significant impairment char ges could have a material
adverse ef fect on our results of operations.
Risks Related to Investments in Indian Companies and International Operations Generally .
We are incorporated in India, and a substantial portion of our assets and our employees are located in India. Consequently , our
financial performance and the market price of our American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) will be af fected by political, social and economic
developments af fecting India, Government of India policies such as taxation and foreign investment policies, Government of India currency
exchange control and changes in exchange rates and interest rates.
Wage incr eases in India may diminish our  competitive advantage against companies located in the United States and Eur ope
and may r educe our  profit margins.
Our wage costs in India have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the United States and Europe for comparably
skilled professionals, and this has been one of our competitive advantages. However , wage increases in India may prevent us from sustaining
this competitive advantage and may negatively af fect our profit mar gins. We may need to increase the levels of our employee compensation
more rapidly than in the past to retain talent. Unless we are able to continue to increase the ef ficiency and productivity of our employees, over
the long term wage increases may reduce our profit mar gins. Furthermore, increases in the proportion of employees with less experience, or
source talent from other low cost locations, like Eastern Europe, China or Southeast Asia could also negatively af fect our profits.

We would r ealize lower  tax benefits if the special tax holiday scheme for  units set up in Special Economic Zones is
substantially modified.
Currently , we benefit from tax incentives under Indian tax laws. We qualify for a deduction from taxable income on profits
attributable to our status as a developer of Special Economic Zones or from operation of units located in Special Economic Zones, or SEZs.
The tax deduction for SEZ developers is available for any ten consecutive years out of fifteen years, commencing from the year in which the
SEZ is notified. The tax deduction for a unit in an SEZ is equal to 100% of profits from the export of services for the first five years after the
commencement of operations in the SEZ, and thereafter is equal to 50% of profits from the export of services for a subsequent period of ten
years, subject to meeting specified re-investment conditions and earmarking of specified reserves in the last five years. This tax deduction will
terminate if our operations are no longer located in an SEZ, fail to comply with rules required for an SEZ or fail to meet certain conditions
prescribed under the Income Tax Act, 1961 of India. These tax benefits of units are conditioned upon our ability to generate positive net
foreign exchange within five years of the commencement of our operations in the SEZ. If we fail to generate positive net foreign exchange
within five years, or thereafter fail to maintain it, we will be subject to penalties under the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act,
1992, or the Indian Foreign Trade Act. The maximum penalty that may be imposed is equal to five times the gross value of the goods and
services that we purchase with duty exemptions. Ef fective for financial years beginning April 1, 201 1, we are subject to a Minimum Alternate
Tax, or MA T, at a fixed rate of approximately 20% on its net profits as adjusted by certain prescribed adjustments. Where any tax is paid under
MAT, such tax will be eligible for adjustment against regular income tax liability computed under the Income Tax Act, 1961 of India, for the
following ten years as MA T credit. We cannot assure you that the Government of India will continue these special tax exemptions or that we
will continue to qualify for such tax benefits and other incentives. If we no longer receive these tax benefits and other incentives, or if the
MAT rate of taxation is increased, our financial results may be adversely af fected.
In the past, there have been demands by legislators and various political parties in India for the Government of India to actively
regulate the development of SEZs by private entities. There have also been demands to impose strict conditions which need to be complied
with before economic zones developed by private entities are designated as SEZs. If such regulations or conditions are imposed, it would
adversely impact our ability to set up new units in such designated SEZs and avail ourselves of the tax benefits associated with SEZs
In the event that the Government of India or  the government of another  country changes its tax policies in a manner  that is
adverse to us, our  tax expense may materially incr ease, r educing our  profitability .
Based on the Finance Act, 2012, and ef fective as of July 1, 2012, the Government of India is levying a service tax on all services
which are not otherwise exempted. Consequently , all services are likely to become taxable at a rate of 12.36%, except enumerated exempted
services.
We operate in jurisdictions that impose transfer  pricing and other  tax r elated r egulations on us, and any failur e to comply
could materially and adversely affect our  profitability .
We are required to comply with various transfer pricing regulations in India and other countries. Failure to comply with such
regulations may impact our ef fective tax rates and consequently af fect our net mar gins. Additionally , we operate in several countries and our
failure to comply with the local tax regime may result in additional taxes, penalties and enforcement actions from local authorities. In the
event that we do not properly comply with transfer pricing and tax-related regulations, our profitability may be adversely af fected. The
Finance Act, 2012 extended the applicability of transfer pricing regulations to domestic transactions entered into with related parties and
certain specified transactions through financial years 2012 and 2013.
Taxation laws are susceptible to frequent change. In India, changes in taxation law are announced on an annual basis in February ,
when the Union Budget is presented. In addition, a new Direct Tax Code is expected to replace the existing Indian Income Tax Act, 1961.
These changes in law may af fect the accuracy of our estimated tax obligations, or the obligations of holders of our equity shares and ADSs.

Terrorist attacks or  a war  could adversely affect our  business, r esults of operations and financial condition.
Terrorist attacks, such as the attacks of September 1 1, 2001 in the United States, the attacks of July 7, 2005 in London, U.K., the
attacks of June 30, 2007 in Glasgow , U.K., the attacks in November 29, 2008 and July 13, 201 1 in Mumbai, India and other acts of violence or
war have the potential to directly impact our clients. To the extent that such attacks af fect or involve the United States or Europe, our business
may be significantly impacted, as the majority of our revenue is derived from clients located in those regions. In addition, such attacks may
make business travel more dif ficult, may make it more dif ficult to obtain work visas for many of our technology professionals who are
required to work in the United States or Europe, and may ef fectively curtail our ability to deliver services to our clients. Such obstacles to
business may increase our expenses and negatively af fect the results of our operations. Furthermore, any terrorist attacks in India could cause a
disruption in the delivery of our services to our clients, could have a negative impact on our business, personnel, assets and results of
operations, and could cause our clients or potential clients to choose other vendors for the services we provide. Terrorist threats, attacks or war
could also delay , postpone or cancel our clients’  decisions to use our services.
The markets in which we operate ar e subject to the risk of earthquakes, floods and other  natural disasters, the occurr ence of
which could cause our  business to suffer .
Some of the regions that we operate in are prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, flooding and other natural disasters. In the
event that any of our business centers are af fected by such disasters, we may sustain damage to our operations and properties, suf fer significant
financial losses and be unable to complete our client engagements in a timely manner , if at all. Further , in the event of a natural disaster , we
may also incur costs in redeploying personnel and property . In addition, if there is a major earthquake, as occurred in Japan in March 201 1, a
flood, as occurred in Thailand in July 201 1, or other natural disaster in any of the locations in which our significant customers are located, we
face the risk that our customers may incur losses or sustained business interruption which may materially impair their ability to continue their
purchase of our products or services. A major earthquake, flood or other natural disaster including as a result of climate changes in the
locations in which we operate could have a material adverse ef fect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Regional conflicts in South Asia could adversely affect the Indian economy , disrupt our  operations and cause our  business to
suffer .
South Asia has from time to time experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries, including between
India and Pakistan. There have been military confrontations between India and Pakistan in the Kashmir region and along the India-Pakistan
border . The potential for hostilities between the two countries is high due to recent terrorist activities in India and the aggravated geopolitical
situation. Both countries have initiated active measures to reduce hostilities. Military activity or terrorist attacks in the future could harm the
Indian economy by disrupting communications and making travel more dif ficult. Such political tensions could create a greater perception that
investments in Indian companies involve a higher degree of risk. This, in turn, could have a material adverse ef fect on the market for the
securities of Indian companies, including our equity shares and our ADSs, and on the market for our services.
Political considerations in the Government of India could delay the liberalization of the Indian economy and adversely affect
economic conditions in India in general, which could in r eturn impact our  financial r esults and pr ospects.
Since 1991, successive Indian Governments have pursued policies of economic liberalization, including significantly relaxing
restrictions on private sector enterprise. Nevertheless, the role of the Indian federal and state governments in the Indian economy as producers,
consumers and regulators has remained significant. Although we believe that the process of economic liberalization will continue, the rate of
economic liberalization could change, and specific laws and policies af fecting technology companies, foreign investment, currency exchange
and other matters af fecting investment in our securities could change as well. A significant change in India’ s economic liberalization and
deregulation policies could adversely af fect business and economic conditions in India generally and our business in particular .
For instance in April 2007, the Government of India announced a number of changes in its policy relating to SEZs, including
specifying a cap on land available for SEZs. The Government of India is also considering making changes in its SEZ policy . We currently have
several facilities operating within SEZs and any adverse change in policy relating to SEZs could af fect our profitability .

Indian law limits our  ability to raise capital outside India and may limit the ability of others to acquir e us, which could
prevent us fr om operating our  business or  entering into a transaction that is in the best inter ests of our  shar eholders.
Indian law constrains our ability to raise capital outside of India through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities.
Generally , any foreign investment in, or an acquisition of, an Indian company requires approval from relevant government authorities in India,
including the Reserve Bank of India. However , subject to certain exceptions, the Government of India currently does not mandate prior
approvals for IT  companies such as ours. If we are required to seek the approval of the Government of India and the Government of India does
not approve the proposed investment or implements a limit on the foreign equity ownership of IT  companies, our ability to seek and obtain
additional equity investment by foreign investors will be limited. In addition, these restrictions, if applied to us, may prevent us from entering
into a transaction, such as an acquisition by a non-Indian company , which would otherwise be beneficial for our Company and the holders of
our equity shares and ADSs.
Our ability to acquir e companies organized outside India depends on the appr oval of the Government of India. Our  failur e to
obtain appr oval fr om the Government of India for  the acquisition of companies organized outside India may r estrict our  international
growth, which could negatively affect our  revenue.
The Ministry of Finance of the Government of India and/or the Reserve Bank of India must approve our acquisition of any company
organized outside of India or grant general or special permission for such acquisition. The Reserve Bank of India permits acquisitions of
companies or ganized outside of India by an Indian party without approval in the following circumstances:
 
 • if the transaction consideration is paid in cash, up to 400% of the net worth of the acquiring company; or
 
 • if the acquisition is funded with cash from the acquiring company’ s existing foreign currency accounts or with cash proceeds from
the issue of ADRs or Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”).
We cannot assure you that any necessary approval from the Reserve Bank of India or the Ministry of Finance or any other
Government agency can be obtained. Our failure to obtain such approvals from the Government of India for acquisitions of companies
organized outside India may restrict our international growth, which could negatively af fect our revenue.
It may be difficult for  you to enfor ce any judgment obtained in the United States against us, our  directors or  executive officers
or our affiliates.
We are incorporated under the laws of India and many of our directors and executive of ficers reside outside the United States. A
substantial portion of our assets and the assets of many of these persons are also located outside the United States. As a result, you may be
unable to ef fect service of process upon us outside of India or upon such persons outside their jurisdiction of residence. In addition, you may
be unable to enforce against us in courts outside of India, or against these persons outside the jurisdiction of their residence, judgments
obtained in courts of the United States, including judgments predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the United States.
We have been advised by our Indian counsel that the United States and India do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the
payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States on civil liability , whether or not predicated solely upon the
federal securities laws of the United States, would not be enforceable in India. However , the party in whose favor such final judgment is
rendered may bring a new suit in a competent court in India based on a final judgment that has been obtained in the United States. The suit
must be brought in India within three years from the date of the judgment in the same manner as any other suit filed to enforce a civil liability
in India. It is unlikely that a court in India would award damages on the same basis as a foreign court if an action is brought in India.
Furthermore, it is unlikely that an Indian court would enforce a foreign judgment if it viewed the amount of damages awarded as excessive or
inconsistent with Indian practice. A party seeking to enforce a foreign judgment in India is required to obtain approval from the Reserve Bank
of India under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, to execute such a judgment or to repatriate any amount recovered.
The laws of India do not pr otect intellectual pr operty rights to the same extent as those of the United States, and we may be
unsuccessful in pr otecting our  intellectual pr operty rights. Unauthorized use of our  intellectual pr operty may r esult in development of
technology , products or  services which compete with our  products. We may also be subject to third-party claims of intellectual
property infringement.
Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade
secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property . However , we cannot be certain that the steps
we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property . Furthermore, the laws of India do not protect proprietary rights to the
same extent as laws in the United States. Therefore, our ef forts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate. Our competitors may
independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products or services. Unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our
products, services or proprietary information.

The misappropriation or duplication of our intellectual property could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and
employees, reduce our revenue and increase our expenses. The competitive advantage that we derive from our intellectual property may also
be diminished or eliminated. We may need to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the
proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation could be time-consuming and costly . As the number of patents, copyrights and other
intellectual property rights in our industry increases, and as the coverage of these rights increases, we believe that companies in our industry
will face more frequent infringement claims. Defending against these claims, even if not meritorious, could be expensive and divert our
attention and resources from operating our company . Also, there can be no assurance that, as our business expands into new areas, we will be
able to independently develop the technology necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing on the intellectual
property rights of others.
Although we believe that our intellectual property rights do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of any other party ,
infringement claims may be asserted against us in the future. If we become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property
rights, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and be forced to develop non-infringing technology , obtain a license or cease
selling the applications or products that contain the infringing technology . We may be unable to develop non-infringing technology or to
obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
Risks Related to the ADSs
Sales of our  equity shar es may adversely affect the prices of our  equity shar es and ADSs.
Sales of substantial amounts of our equity shares in the public market, including sales by insiders, or the perception that such sales
may occur , could adversely af fect the prevailing market price of our equity shares or our ADSs or our ability to raise capital through an
offering of our securities. In connection with the Demer ger, equity shares of Wipro now represent shares in a more specialized company
comprised exclusively of the IT  Services and IT  Products business segments. As a result, Wipro’ s current shareholders may decide to sell their
Wipro equity shares if they consider them to no longer be appropriate for their investment portfolios. This could have a material adverse ef fect
on the liquidity and share price of our equity shares and the trading price of our equity shares may decrease.
The exchange of equity shares of Wipro in the public market in connection with the Demer ger could adversely af fect the prevailing
market price of our equity shares or ADSs, or our ability to raise capital through an of fering of its securities. It could also create volatility and
impact the market price of our equity shares or ADSs. In the future, we may also sponsor the sale of shares currently held by some of our
shareholders, or issue new shares. We can make no prediction as to the timing of any such sales or the ef fect, if any , that future sales of our
equity shares, or the availability of our equity shares for future sale, will have on the market price of our equity shares or ADSs prevailing
from time to time.
The price of our  ADSs and the U.S. dollar  value of any dividends we declar e may be negatively affected by fluctuations in the
U.S. dollar  to Indian rupee exchange rate.
Our ADSs trade on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) in U.S. dollars. Since the equity shares underlying the ADSs are listed
in India on the BSE Limited (“BSE”) and National Stock Exchange (“NSE”) and trade in Indian rupees, the value of the ADSs may be
affected by exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. In addition, dividends declared, if any , are denominated in
Indian rupees, and therefore the value of the dividends received by the holders of ADSs in U.S. dollars will be af fected by exchange rate
fluctuations. If the Indian rupee depreciates against the U.S. dollar , the price at which our ADSs trade and the value of the U.S. dollar
equivalent of any dividend will decrease accordingly .
An active or  liquid trading market for  our ADSs is not assur ed.
An active, liquid trading market for our ADSs may not be maintained in the long term. Loss of liquidity could increase the price
volatility of our ADSs.
Indian law imposes for eign investment r estrictions that limit a holder ’s ability to convert equity shar es into ADSs, which may
cause our  ADSs to trade at a pr emium or  discount to the market price of our  equity shar es.
Under certain circumstances, the Reserve Bank of India must approve the sale of equity shares underlying ADSs by a non-resident of
India to a resident of India. The Reserve Bank of India has given general permission to ef fect sales of existing shares or convertible debentures
of an Indian company by a resident to a non-resident, subject to certain conditions, including the price at which the shares may be sold.
Additionally , except under certain limited circumstances, if an investor seeks to convert the rupee proceeds from a sale of equity shares in
India into foreign currency and then repatriate that foreign currency from India, he or she will have to obtain additional approval from the
Reserve Bank of India for each transaction. Required approval from the Reserve Bank of India or any other government agency may not be
obtained on terms which are favorable to a non-resident investor or may not be obtained at all.

Investors who exchange ADSs for the underlying equity shares and are not holders of record will be required to declare to us details
of the holder of record, and the holder of record will be required to disclose the details of the beneficial owner . Any investor who fails to
comply with this requirement may be liable for a fine of up to Rs. 1,000 for each day such failure continues. Such restrictions on foreign
ownership of the underlying equity shares may cause our ADSs to trade at a premium or discount to the equity shares.
Our ADSs have historically traded at a significant pr emium to the trading prices of our  underlying equity shar es on Indian
stock exchanges, but may not continue to do so in the futur e.
Historically , our ADSs have traded at a premium to the trading prices of our underlying equity shares on Indian stock exchanges due
to the relatively small portion of our market capitalization represented by ADSs, restrictions imposed by Indian law on the conversion of
equity shares into ADSs, and the potential preference of some investors to trade securities listed on U.S. exchanges. The completion of any
additional secondary ADS of fering will increase the number of our outstanding ADSs. Further , the restrictions on the issuance of ADSs
imposed by Indian law may be relaxed in the future. Over a period of time, investor preferences may also change. Therefore, the historical
premium of our ADSs as compared to the trading prices of our underlying equity shares on Indian stock exchanges may be reduced or
eliminated.
Negative media coverage and public scrutiny may adversely affect the prices of our  equity shar es and ADSs.
Media coverage, including social media coverage such as blogs, of our business practices, employees, policies and actions has
increased dramatically over the past several years. Any negative media coverage, regardless of the accuracy of such reporting, may have an
initial adverse impact on our reputation and investor confidence, resulting in a decline in the share price of our equity shares and our ADSs.
Holders of ADSs ar e subject to the Securities and Exchange Board of India’ s Takeover  Code with r espect to their  acquisitions
of ADSs or  the underlying equity shar es, and this may impose r equir ements on such holders with r espect to disclosur e and offers to
purchase additional ADSs or  equity shar es.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 201 1 (the “T akeover
Code”) is applicable to publicly listed Indian companies such as Wipro and to any person acquiring our equity shares or voting rights in our
company , including ADSs.
Under the Takeover Code, persons who acquire 5% or more of the shares of a company are required, within two working days of such
acquisition, to disclose the aggregate shareholding and voting rights in the company to the company and to the stock exchanges on which the
shares of the company are listed.
Additionally , holders of 5% or more of the shares or voting rights of a company who acquire or dispose of shares representing 2% or
more of the shares or voting rights of the company must disclose, within two working days of such transaction their revised shareholding to
the company and to the stock exchanges on which the shares of the company are listed. This disclosure is required even if the transaction is a
sale which results in the holder ’s ownership to fall below 5%. The Takeover Code also may impose conditions that discourage a potential
acquirer , which could prevent an acquisition of our company in a transaction that could be beneficial for our equity holders.
An investor  in our  ADSs may not be able to exer cise pr eemptive rights for  additional shar es and may ther eby suffer  dilution of
his or  her equity inter est in us.
Under the Indian Companies Act, a company incorporated in India must of fer its holders of equity shares preemptive rights to
subscribe and pay for a proportionate number of shares to maintain their existing ownership percentages prior to the issuance of any new
equity shares, unless such preemptive rights have been waived by three-fourths of the shares voting on the resolution to waive such rights.
Holders of ADSs may be unable to exercise preemptive rights for the equity shares underlying ADSs unless a registration statement under the
Securities Act is ef fective with respect to such rights or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available. We
are not obligated to prepare and file such a registration statement, and our decision to do so will depend on the costs and potential liabilities
associated with any such registration statement, as well as the perceived benefits of enabling the holders of ADSs to exercise their preemptive
rights, and any other factors we consider appropriate at the time. No assurance can be given that we would file a registration statement under
these circumstances. If we issue any such securities in the future, such securities may be issued to the Depositary , which may sell such
securities for the benefit of the holders of the ADSs. There can be no assurance as to the value, if any , the Depositary would receive upon the
sale of such securities. To the extent that holders of ADSs are unable to exercise preemptive rights granted in respect of the equity shares
represented by their ADSs, their proportional interests in the Company would be reduced.

ADS holders may be r estricted in their  ability to exer cise voting rights.
At our request, the Depositary will mail to you any notice of shareholders’  meeting received from us along with information
explaining how to instruct the Depositary to exercise the voting rights of the securities represented by ADSs. If the Depositary receives voting
instructions from you prior to such shareholders’  meeting, relating to matters that have been forwarded to you, it will endeavor to vote the
securities represented by your ADSs in accordance with such voting instructions. However , the ability of the Depositary to carry out voting
instructions may be limited by practical and legal limitations and the terms of the securities on deposit. We cannot assure that you will receive
voting materials in time to enable you to return voting instructions to the Depositary in a timely manner . Securities for which no voting
instructions have been received will not be voted. There may be other communications, notices or of ferings that we only make to holders of
our equity shares, which will not be forwarded to holders of ADSs. Accordingly , you may not be able to participate in all of ferings,
transactions or votes that are made available to holders of our equity shares.
We may be classified as a passive for eign investment company , which could r esult in adverse United States federal income tax
consequence to U.S. holders.
Based on the current price of our ADSs and the composition of our income and assets, we do not believe that we are a “passive
foreign investment company ,” or PFIC, for United States federal income tax purposes for our current taxable year ended March 31, 2013.
However , a separate determination must be made after the close of each taxable year as to whether we are a PFIC. We cannot assure you that
we will not be a PFIC for any future taxable year . If we were treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a United States holder held
an equity share or an ADS, certain adverse United States federal income tax consequences could apply to the United States holder . See

The Demer ger of the Diversified Business
Effective as of March 31, 2013 (“Ef fective Date”), the consumer care and lighting, infrastructure engineering and other non-IT
business segments (collectively , the “Diversified Business”) were demer ged (the “Demer ger”) into Wipro Enterprises Limited, formerly
known as Azim Premji Custodial Private Limited (“Resulting Company”), a company incorporated under the laws of India. The Demer ger was
effected pursuant to a scheme of arrangement (“Scheme”) approved by the High Court of Karnataka, Bangalore. The Scheme is included as an
exhibit to the Form 6-K filed on December 1 1, 2012. Pursuant to the Scheme, all shareholders of Wipro received either securities of the
Resulting Company or the equivalent value in additional shares of Wipro.
In connection with the Demer ger, all subsidiaries which pertained to the Diversified Business were transferred to the Resulting
Company . Certain of these subsidiaries in turn possessed subsidiaries which do not pertain to the Diversified Business and instead are
considered a portion of the IT  Services business segment. Therefore, the Resulting Company is now in the process of completing the transfer
of the IT  Services related subsidiaries back to Wipro. In the interim, the board of directors of the Resulting Company has authorized Wipro to
retain all operating and management control of such subsidiaries, including the power to govern the operating and financial policies, the
appointing of a majority of the board of directors, and appointment of key management personnel.
Following the Demer ger of the Diversified Business, Wipro transferred certain trademarks, patents, copyrights and design rights that
related to the Diversified Business to the Resulting Company . Similarly , Wipro Trademarks Holding Limited transferred certain trademarks,
patents, copyrights and design rights that related to the Diversified Business to the Resulting Company . In addition, Wipro Trademarks
Holding Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company , owns certain trademarks that are used both by Wipro and the Resulting
Company pursuant to the Scheme. Such details are provided in Schedule III Part A to D annexed to the Scheme of Arrangement approved by
the High Court of Karnataka.
Pursuant to the Court order approving the Demer ger, for a period of ten years from the ef fective date of the Demer ger, the Company
may not, except with the express prior written consent of the Resulting Company , engage in, or be connected as a controlling shareholder with
any company which engages in any activities that are in competition to the Diversified Business, and the Resulting Company may not, except
with the express prior written consent of the Company , engage in, or be connected as a controlling shareholder with any company which
engages in any activities that are in competition to the primary business of the Company .
Following the Ef fective Date, the Diversified Business is classified and presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements as
discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. The Demer ger is
considered a common control transaction and therefore IFRS 3, Business Combination and IFRIC 17, Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations, are inapplicable. Accordingly , assets and liabilities of the Diversified Business as on the Ef fective Date will be
reported at their carrying values. As of the Ef fective Date, the consumer care and lighting segment, infrastructure engineering and other non-IT
business segments are reported as discontinued operations. Please see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding the treatment of discontinued operations.
Industry Overview
IT Services
Companies are increasingly turning to of fshore IT  service providers to meet their need for high quality , cost competitive technology
solutions and IT  services. Spending on global sourcing in 2012 grew by 9% over 201 1, nearly twice as fast as global technology spending,
according to the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) Strategic Review Report 2013. Of fshore IT  service
providers of fer a range of end to end software development, IT  business solutions, research and development services, business process
outsourcing (BPO), consulting and related support functions.
Over the past two decades, India has risen to become the leading destination for global sourcing of IT , BPO and research and
development services. Established Indian IT  services companies have a proven track record for providing business and technology solutions,
offering a lar ge, high quality and English-speaking talent pool, and a friendly regulatory environment. These factors have facilitated India’ s
emer gence as a global outsourcing hub. The following are key factors contributing to the growth of India-based IT  services:
 
 • Global sourcing from India of fers significant cost advantages in terms of accessing highly skilled talent at lower wage costs as well
as productivity gains derived from having a very competent employee base. According to the NASSCOM Strategic Review Report
2013, Indian service providers have been able to maintain their cost competitiveness by deploying various control strategies

 • India has a lar ge, highly skilled and English-speaking talent pool. According to the NASSCOM Strategic Review Report 2013, the
Indian information technology business process management industry employed nearly 3 million software professionals as of
March 31, 2013, making it one of the lar gest employers in the global IT  services industry .
 
 • Favorable policy decisions of the Government of India have played an instrumental role in the development of robust IT  and BPO
sectors in the country . The Software Technology Park (“STP”) Scheme and the Special Economic Zone Act also played a dominant
role in the emer gence and development of the IT  and BPO industries by providing incentives in the form of tax holidays.
 
 • The Indian IT  industry has been the primary beneficiary of the rapid transformation of the telecom sector as deregulation has
resulted in the rapid decline of the cost of international connectivity and improvement in service level quality .
 
 • India-based IT  companies have proven their ability to deliver premium IT  and BPO services that satisfy the requirements of
international clients who adhere to the highest quality standards.
While exports remain the focus area for the Indian IT  industry , domestic IT  services represent approximately 22% of the total Indian
IT service industry and are expected to be a key growth driver . According to the NASSCOM Strategic Review Report FY13, Indian IT  export
revenues, excluding hardware, are expected to grow at 10.2% in 2013. This growth will be driven by all customer segments, and particularly
across government, enterprise consumers and small and medium businesses.
IT Products
According to the NASSCOM Strategic Review Report 2013, the hardware market in India accounted for 40% of the domestic IT
industry , with anticipated growth of 1.4% in fiscal 2013. The key components of the hardware industry are servers, desktop and notebook
computers, storage devices, peripherals, printers and networking equipment. Increased use of computing devices in education and consistent
demand from enterprises are key factors driving the continued growth of this market. Additionally , the Government of India is promoting
initiatives to provide low cost, af fordable computing devices, which is expected to also fuel growth. Increased adoption of virtualization and
cloud computing technologies, lar ge-scale digitization and the increased importance of big data and analytics have also contributed to growth
in the server and storage markets. Demand for networking equipment is increasing as businesses invest in expanding and upgrading their
infrastructure and as market penetration of mobile devices, teleconferencing and voice over internet protocol (“VOIP”) increases.

information technology practice of the Commercial Business Services Business Unit of Science Applications International Corporation, or

Sales and Marketing for  IT Services
Our sales operations are global so we can satisfy the requirements of global companies. Our sales ef forts are complemented by our
marketing team, which assists in brand building and other corporate and field-level marketing ef forts.
Sales:  We believe that the “customer” always comes first. We believe we can achieve higher levels of client sales and client
satisfaction by structuring ourselves based on the following key elements:
 
 • Client Relationship: We have designated global client partners that have primary responsibility for the client relationship, providing
single person accountability and single person sales responsibility .
 
 • Industry Focus: Our sales teams are dedicated to a specific industry segment and often have significant experience and training in
their industry .
 
 • Proactive Solutioning: We have a consulting led approach to sales where our sales teams provide proactive solutions to prospective
clients rather than only of fer our software services capabilities.
 
 • Geographic Focus: Our sales teams are dedicated to a specific country or region to increase our knowledge of the local business
culture, anticipate prospective and existing client needs and increase our market penetration.
Marketing:  Our marketing or ganization complements our sales teams by:

These competitors are located internationally as well as in India. We expect that competition will further increase and will potentially
include companies from other countries that have lower personnel costs than in India. A significant part of our competitive advantage has
historically been a wage cost advantage relative to companies in the United States and Europe. Because wage costs in India are presently
increasing at a faster rate than those in the United States, our ability to compete ef fectively will increasingly become dependent on our ability
to provide high quality , on-time, complex deliverables that depend on increased expertise in certain technical areas. We also believe that our
ability to compete will depend on a number of factors not within our control, including:
 
 • the ability of our competitors to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled IT  services professionals;
 
 • the extent to which our international competitors expand their operations in India and benefit from the favorable wage dif ferential;
 
 • the price at which our competitors of fer their services; and
 
 • the extent to which our competitors can respond to a client’ s needs.
We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors and distinguish ourselves through consistently providing
quality leadership, our ability to create client loyalty and our expertise in select tar geted market.

single point of accountability through designated global client partners. Our global client partners receive support from our corporate
marketing team to assist in brand building and other corporate level marketing ef forts for various market segments.
IT Products Competition
The IT  products market is a dynamic and highly competitive market. In the marketplace, we compete with both international and local

Lenovo, Acer , Sony and Toshiba.
One of the major challenges we encounter is mar gin pressure due to competitive pricing. Achieving mindshare and market share in a

Intellectual Pr operty
Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and design
laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property . We require employees,
independent contractors and, whenever possible, vendors to enter into confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their
relationships with us. These confidentiality agreements generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information being developed by
us or on our behalf be kept confidential. These agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed to third
parties in the course of our business be kept confidential by such third parties. However , our clients usually own the intellectual property in the
software we develop for them.
Our ef forts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate. Our competitors may independently develop similar technology
or duplicate our products and/or services. Unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products, services or proprietary
information. In addition, India has now complied with all World Trade Or ganization (“WT O”) requirements with respect to intellectual
property protection, which means that India meets the international mandatory and statutory requirements regarding the protection of
intellectual property rights.
We could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our product or service
offerings overlap with those of our competitors. In addition, we may become subject to such claims since we may not always be able to verify
the intellectual property rights of third parties from which we license a variety of technologies. Defending against these claims, even if not
meritorious, could be expensive and divert our attention from operating our company . If we become liable to third parties for infringing their
intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay substantial damage awards and be forced to develop non-infringing technology , obtain
a license or cease selling the applications that contain the infringing technology . The loss of some of our existing licenses could delay the
introduction of software enhancements, interactive tools and other new products and services until equivalent technology could be licensed or
developed. We may be unable to develop non-infringing technology or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
As of March 31, 2013, our continuing operations held more than 500 registered trademarks including registered community
trademarks in India, Japan, the United States, Malaysia and over 60 other countries. We also have 124 registered patents in various countries.
We have approximately 87 patent applications and over 200 trademark applications pending for registration in various jurisdictions across the
world.
Following the Demer ger of the Diversified Business, Wipro transferred certain trademarks, patents, copyrights and design rights that
related to the Diversified Business to the Resulting Company . Similarly , Wipro Trademarks Holding Limited transferred certain trademarks,
patents, copyrights and design rights that related to the Diversified Business to the Resulting Company . In addition, Wipro Trademarks
Holdings Limited owns certain trademarks that are used both by Wipro and the Resulting Company . Such details are provided in Schedule III
Part A to D annexed to the Scheme of Arrangement approved by the High Court of Karnataka.
Our continuing operations have more than 400 registrations completed with respect to WIPRO and the Flower logo trademarks in
over 60 territories across the world (including Madrid Protocol countries) and more than 120 trademark applications pending registration in
India, Iran, Vietnam, Iraq, Malaysia, Singapore, Nepal, Sri Lanka and other countries. These overseas registrations also include our
applications in the EU (via the Community Trade Mark).
Effect of Government Regulation on our  Business
Regulation of our business by the Government of India af fects our business in several ways. We benefit from certain tax incentives
promulgated by the Government of India, including the export of IT  services from Special Economic Zones (SEZs). As a result of this
incentive, our operations have been subject to relatively lower Indian tax liabilities. The tax holiday for all of our Software Technology Parks
and Export Oriented Units expired in fiscal year 201 1. We have also benefited from the liberalization and deregulation of the Indian economy
by successive Indian government administrations since 1991, including the current administration.
Indian laws also place additional restrictions on our business, including that we are generally required to obtain approval under the
Factories Act and the Shops and Establishment Act, from the Reserve Bank of India and/or the Ministry of Finance of the Government of India
to acquire companies or ganized outside India, and we are generally required, subject to some exceptions, to obtain approval from relevant
government authorities in India in order to raise capital outside India or conduct other activities. We may also be required to obtain the
approval of the Indian stock exchanges and/or the Securities and Exchange Board of India to take certain actions, such as the acquisition of, or
merger with, another company . The conversion of our equity shares into ADSs is governed by guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India.

Finally , we are subject to several legislative provisions relating to storage of explosives, environmental protection, pollution control,
essential commodities and operation of manufacturing facilities. Noncompliance with these provisions may lead to civil and criminal liability
or delays in obtaining approval from the requisite governmental authorities.
Please see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 3, Key Information, as well as the section titled “Additional Information” in
Item 10, for more information on the ef fects of governmental regulation on our business.

This Annual Report on Form 20-F contains, and future filings with the SEC may contain, non-GAAP  financial measures within the
meaning of Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, under which “GAAP” and “non-GAAP” for a foreign private issuer means the
principles under which its primary financial statements are prepared, or IFRS and non-IFRS. Such non-GAAP  financial measures are measures
of our historical or future performance, financial position or cash flows that are adjusted to exclude or include amounts that are excluded or
included, as the case may be, from the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS.
The following table provides our adjusted profit for the year , which is a non-GAAP  financial measure that excludes the impact of
accelerated amortization in respect of stock options that vest in a graded manner . This non-GAAP  financial measure is not based on any
comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for , or superior to, the most directly comparable
financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. In addition to this non-GAAP  financial measure, readers should carefully review and
evaluate our financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as well as the reconciliation of this non-GAAP  financial measure with the
most directly comparable IFRS financial measure.
A reconciliation of adjusted non-GAAP  profit, which excludes the impact of accelerated amortization in respect of stock options that
vest in a graded manner , with total profits from continuing operations as calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, is as follows:
 
   Year ended Mar ch 31,  
   2011   2012   2013  
Total profits attributable to equity holders for the year as per
IFRS   Rs. 52,977    Rs. 55,730    Rs. 66,359   
Adjustments:     
Accelerated amortization of stock options that vest in a
graded manner    (376)   (125)   (321) 
     
    
    
Adjusted non-GAAP  profit   Rs. 52,601    Rs. 55,605    Rs. 66,038   
     
    
    
Profits from continuing operations attributable to equity holders
for the year as per IFRS   Rs. 49,938    Rs. 52,325    Rs. 61,362   
Adjustments:     
Accelerated amortization of stock options that vest in a
graded manner    (377)   (121)   (308) 
     
    
    
Adjusted non-GAAP  profit from continuing operation   Rs. 49,561    Rs. 52,204    Rs. 61,054   
     
    
    
The Company believes that the presentation of this non-GAAP  adjusted profit, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding
IFRS measure, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company’ s
profit for the period. The Company considers a stock option award with a graded vesting schedule to be a single award and not multiple stock
option awards. Further , the Company considers the services of the employee in each year , covered by the stock option award to be equally
valuable and accordingly believes that straight line amortization reflects the economic substance of the stock awards. However , under IFRS,
the Company records the related stock compensation expenses on an accelerated basis. Therefore, we believe that making available an
adjusted profit number that excludes the impact of accelerated amortization from profit provides useful supplemental information to both
management and investors about our financial and business trends.
For our internal budgeting process, our management also uses financial statements that do not include the impact of accelerated
amortization relating to stock options that vest in a graded manner . The management of the Company also uses non-GAAP  adjusted profit, in
addition to the corresponding IFRS measures, in reviewing our financial results.

A material limitation associated with the use of non-GAAP  profit as compared to the IFRS measure of profit is that it does not include
costs which are recurring in nature and may not be comparable with the calculation of profit for other companies in our industry . The
Company compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of the ef fects of non-GAAP  measures, by presenting the
corresponding IFRS financial measure and by providing a reconciliation to the corresponding IFRS measure.
Results of operations for  the years ended Mar ch 31, 2013 and 2012
 
 • Our revenue from continuing operations increased by 17.02%. This was driven primarily by a 19.03% and 2.09% increase in
revenue from our IT  Services and IT  Products business segments, respectively .
 
 • Our gross profit as percentage of our revenue from continuing operations improved by 95 basis points (bps). This was primarily on
account of improvement in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from our IT  Services segment by 80 bps. This improvement was
partially of fset by a decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from our IT  Products segment by 145 bps.
 
 • Our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue from continuing operations increased from 5.57% for the year
ended March 31, 2012 to 6.42% for the year ended March 31, 2013. In absolute terms selling and marketing expenses increased by
34.87%, primarily due to an increase in such expenses in the IT  Services segment.
 
 • Our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from continuing operations increased from 5.72% for the year
ended March 31, 2012 to 5.85% for the year ended March 31, 2013. In absolute terms general and administrative expenses
increased by 19.64%, primarily due to an increase in such expenses in both the IT  Services segment and IT  Products segment.
 
 • As a result of the foregoing factors, our operating income from continuing operations increased by 16.79%, from Rs. 59,912 for the
year ended March 31, 2012 to Rs. 69,972 for the year ended March 31, 2013.
 
 • Our finance expenses from continuing operations decreased from Rs. 3,371 for the year ended March 31, 2012 to Rs. 2,693 for the
year ended March 31, 2013. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease of Rs. 604 in exchange loss on foreign currency
borrowings and related derivative instruments. This decrease is also due to a decrease in interest expense by Rs. 74 during the year
ended March 31, 2013.
 
 • Our finance and other income from continuing operations increased from Rs. 8,982 for the year ended March 31, 2012 to Rs.

income increased by Rs. 271 during the year ended March 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2012. This increase
was due to an increase in cash available for investments due to increased availability of cash flows.

ended March 31, 2012 to 21.52% for the year ended March 31, 2013. This increase is primarily due to changes in our taxable
profits which resulted in a lower proportion of exempt income, but this was partially of fset by a higher deferred tax asset due to a
rate change.
 
 • As a result of the foregoing factors, our profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders increased by Rs. 9,037, or
17.27%, from Rs. 52,325 for the year ended March 31, 2012 to Rs. 61,362 for the year ended March 31, 2013.

revenue from our IT  Services and IT  Products business segments, respectively .
 
 • Our gross profit as percentage of our revenue from continuing operations decreased by 149 basis points (bps). This was primarily

 • Our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue from continuing operations increased from 5.16% for the year
ended March 31, 201 1 to 5.57% for the year ended March 31, 2012. In absolute terms, selling and marketing expenses increased by
27.84%, primarily due to an increase in such expenses in the IT  Services segment.
 
 • Our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from continuing operations decreased from 6.19% for the year
ended March 31, 201 1 to 5.72% for the year ended March 31, 2012. In absolute terms, general and administrative expenses
increased by 9.34%, primarily due to increased expenses in the IT  Services segment.

 • Our finance expenses from continuing operations increased from Rs. 1,924 for the year ended March 31, 201 1 to Rs. 3,371 for the
year ended March 31, 2012. This increase is primarily due to an increase of Rs.1,277 in exchange loss on foreign currency

year ended March 31, 2012, attributable to higher loans and borrowing rates.

sale of investments during the same period.
 
 • Our income taxes relating to continuing operations increased by Rs. 4,077, from Rs. 8,878 for the year ended March 31, 201 1 to

year ended March 31, 201 1 to 19.77% for the year ended March 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to the expiration of the
tax holiday period for STPs, which resulted in a substantial portion of our pre-tax income becoming subject to taxation. The
increase is partially of fset by an increase in profits from our operations in SEZ units.
 
 • As a result of the foregoing factors, our profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders increased by Rs. 2,387, or
4.78%, from Rs. 49,938 for the year ended March 31, 201 1 to Rs. 52,325 for the year ended March 31, 2012.

manufacturing and Hi-tech companies, a 4.0% increase in revenue from the financial services sector and a 3.6% increase in

infrastructure engineering and other non-IT  business segments (collectively , the “Diversified Business”), were demer ged (the “Demer ger”)
into Wipro Enterprises Limited (“Resulting Company”), a company incorporated under the laws of India. The Demer ger was ef fected pursuant
to a scheme of arrangement (“Scheme”) approved by the High Court of Karnataka, Bangalore. Therefore under IFRS, the Diversified Business
is shown as discontinued operations. Net operating income for discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2013 was Rs. 5,176, an
increase of 26% over last year , which was primarily due to higher revenue growth from the international consumer care business, through
improved volume and realizations from the soap category within the India business.
Acquisitions
An active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy . In the last three fiscal years, we have invested in the
aggregate over Rs. 19,200 (including over Rs. 9,400 towards investment in newly acquired subsidiaries and other non-IT  business related
acquisitions, which were transferred to the Resulting Company) to acquire companies including the acquisition of the global oil and gas
information technology practice of the Commercial Business Services Unit of Science Applications International Corporation Inc. (“SAIC”)
and certain of its group companies. The oil and gas business of SAIC provides consulting, system integration and outsourcing services to
major global oil companies with significant domain capabilities in the areas of digital oil fields, petro-technical data management and
petroleum application services, focusing on the upstream segment. Typically the significant majority of our integration activities relating to an
acquisition are substantially completed within three to six months after the acquisition date.
We believe our acquisition program supports our long-term strategic direction, strengthens our competitive position particularly in
acquiring new domain expertise, expands our customer base, increases our ability to expand our service of ferings and provides a greater scale
to grow our earnings and increase stockholders’  value. See Note 7 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information related to our acquisitions.
We routinely review potential acquisitions. We currently expect to finance our acquisitions through cash generated from operations,
cash and cash equivalents and investments in liquid and short-term mutual funds as of March 31, 2013. However , for strategic acquisitions, we
could decide to or be required to obtain additional debt or equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if needed, will be
available on favorable terms, or if at all.

Foreign exchange gains/(losses), net
Our net foreign exchange gains/(losses), from continuing operations for the years ended March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013 were Rs.
503, Rs. 3,328 and Rs. 2,626 respectively .
Our foreign exchange gains/(losses), net, comprise of:
 
 • exchange dif ferences arising from the translation or settlement of transactions in foreign currency , except for exchange dif ferences
on debt denominated in foreign currency (which are reported within finance expense, net); and
 
 • the changes in fair value for derivatives not designated as hedging derivatives and inef fective portions of the hedging instruments.
For forward foreign exchange contracts which are designated and ef fective as cash flow hedges, the marked to market gains and
losses are deferred and reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholder ’s equity and subsequently recorded
in the income statement when the hedged transactions occur , along with the hedged items.
Although our functional currency is the Indian rupee, we transact a significant portion of our business in foreign currencies, in
particular the U.S. dollar . The exchange rate between the rupee and the dollar has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate
substantially in the future. Consequently , the results of our operations are af fected as the rupee fluctuates against the U.S. dollar . Our exchange
rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues, cash balances, payables and debt. We enter into derivative instruments to
primarily hedge our forecasted cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies, foreign currency debt and net investment in overseas
operations. Please refer to Notes 13 and 16 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our foreign
currency exposures.
Finance expenses
Our finance expenses are comprised of interest expense on borrowings, impairment losses recognized on financial assets, gains/losses
on translation or settlement of foreign currency borrowings and changes in fair value and gains/losses on settlement of related derivative
instruments, except foreign exchange gains/losses on short-term borrowings which are considered as a natural economic hedge for the foreign
currency monetary assets which are classified as foreign exchange gains/losses, net within results from operating activities. Borrowing costs
are recognized in the statement of income using the ef fective interest method.
Finance and other  income
Our finance and other income comprises interest income on deposits, dividend income and gains on disposal of available-for -sale
financial assets. Interest income is recognized using the ef fective interest method. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive
payment is established.
Income Taxes
Our profits for the period earned from providing services at client premises outside India are subject to tax in the country where we
perform the work. Most of our taxes paid in countries other than India can be applied as a credit against our Indian tax liability to the extent
that the same income is subject to taxation in India.
Currently , we benefit from certain tax incentives under Indian tax laws. These tax incentives include a tax holiday from payment of
Indian corporate income taxes for our businesses operating from specially designated Special Economic Zones. The tax holiday for all our
Software Technology and Hardware Technology Parks ended in the fiscal year ended March 31, 201 1. Previously , we benefited from a ten
year income tax deduction of 100% for profits derived from exporting information technology services from Software Technology and
Hardware Technology Parks. We continue to be eligible for exemptions from other taxes, including customs duties in these Software
Technology and Hardware Technology Parks.
Special Economic Zone. Units in designated Special Economic Zones which began providing services on or after April 1, 2005, are
eligible for a deduction of 100% of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from commencement of
provision of services and 50% of such profits or gains for a further five years. Certain tax benefits are also available for a further five years
subject to the unit meeting defined conditions.
Due to these tax incentives, a substantial portion of our pre-tax income has not been subject to a significant tax in India in recent
years. When our tax holiday and income tax deduction/exemptions expire or terminate, our costs will increase. The Government of India could
enact laws in the future, which could reduce or eliminate the tax incentives which benefit our business. The expiration period of the tax
holiday for each unit within a SEZ is determined based on the number of years since commencement of production by that unit for a
maximum of fifteen years. The tax holiday period currently available to the Company expires in various years through fiscal year 2026. The
impact of tax holidays has resulted in a decrease of current tax expense from our continuing operations of Rs. 9,368, Rs. 7,953 and Rs. 9,244
for the years ended March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013 respectively , compared to the ef fective tax amounts that we estimate we would have been
required to pay if these incentives had not been available. The per share ef fect of these tax incentives for the years ended March 31, 201 1,
2012 and 2013 was Rs. 3.84, Rs. 3.25 and Rs. 3.77 respectively .

The Company had received tax demands aggregating to Rs. 39,356 (including interest of Rs. 12,170 ) arising primarily on account of
denial of deduction under section 10A  of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in respect of profit earned by the Company’ s undertaking in Software
Technology Park at Bangalore for the years ended March 31, 2001 to March 31, 2008. The appeals filed against the said demand before the
Appellate authorities have been allowed in favor of the Company by the second appellate authority for the years up to March 31, 2007. Further
appeals have been filed by the Income tax authorities before the Honorable High Court. For the year ended March 31, 2008, based on DRP
directions confirming the position of the assessing of ficer, the final assessment order was passed by the assessing of ficer. The Company has
filed an appeal against the said order before the Appellate Tribunal.
In March 2013, the Company received the draft assessment order , on similar grounds as that of earlier years, with a demand of Rs.
8,164 (including interest of Rs. 848) for the financial year ended March 31, 2009. The Company will file its objections against the said
demand before the Dispute Resolution Panel, within the time limit prescribed under the statute.
Considering the facts and nature of disallowance and the order of the appellate authority upholding the claims of the Company for
earlier years, we believe that the final outcome of the above disputes should be in our favor and there should not be any material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.
Although we currently believe we will ultimately prevail in our appeals, the result of such appeals, and any subsequent appeals,
cannot be predicted with certainty . Should we fail to prevail in our appeal, or any subsequent appeals, in any reporting period, the operating
results of such reporting period could be materially adversely af fected.
Pursuant to the changes in the Indian income tax laws, Minimum Alternate Tax (MA T) has been extended to income in respect of
which a deduction is claimed under Sections 10A  and 10B. Consequently , we have calculated our domestic tax liability after considering MA T
and accordingly , a deferred tax asset of Rs. 1,223 and Rs. 1,842 has been recognized in the statement of financial position for the years ended
March 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively . The excess tax paid under MA T provisions over and above normal tax liability can be carried forward
for a period of ten years and set-of f against future tax liabilities computed under normal tax provisions.
Liquidity and Capital Resour ces
The Company’ s cash flow from its operating, investing and financing activities, including from discontinued operations, as reflected
in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 1 10, is summarized in the table below:

equivalent    523    1,680     789    1,157     (891) 
As of March 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalent and short-term investments, including discontinued operations, of Rs.
163,469. Cash and cash equivalent and short-term investments, net of debt, was Rs. 99,653. Please see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding the treatment of discontinued operations.
In addition, we have unused credit lines of Rs. 25,607. To utilize these lines of credit requires the consent of the lender and
compliance with certain financial covenants. We have historically financed our working capital and capital expenditures through our operating
cash flows and through bank debt, as required.
Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2013 increased by Rs. 30,346, while profit for the year increased
by Rs. 10,709 during the same period. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to our revenue growth and more
efficient collection of outstanding invoices in the IT  Services segment. Further , operating cash flow increased due to increase in trade payables
and accrued expenses resulting from improved management of payment terms.
Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2012 decreased by Rs. 361, while profit for the year increased by
Rs. 2,666 during the same period. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to an increase in trade receivables
including unbilled revenues, attributable to higher revenue from the IT  Services segment. Further , operating cash flow increased due to an
increase in trade payables and accrued expenses resulting from improved management of payment terms.

Cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2013 was Rs. 57,573. We purchased (net of sales) available for sale
investments and inter -corporate deposits amounting to Rs. 37,133. Cash provided by operating activities was utilized for the payment for
business acquisitions amounting to Rs. 3,074. Expenses from the operation and management of certain subsidiaries of the Resulting Company
that pertain to the IT  business and are in the process of being transferred back to Wipro consumed Rs 8,276. We purchased property , plant and
equipment amounting to Rs. 10,616, which was primarily driven by the growth strategy of the Company . Further , the Company transferred
cash pursuant to the Demer ger to the Resulting Company amounting to Rs 4,163.
Cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2012 was Rs. 8,056. Cash provided by operating activities was utilized
for the payment for business acquisitions amounting to Rs. 7,920. We also sold (net of purchases) available for sale investments and inter -
corporate deposits amounting to Rs. 4,057. We purchased property , plant and equipment amounting to Rs. 12,977, which was primarily driven
by the growth strategy of the Company .
Cash used in financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2013 was Rs. 6,721 as against Rs. 17,397 for the year ended March 31,
2012. This decrease is primarily due to net proceeds from loans and borrowings amounting to Rs. 1 1,394 and payment of dividend amounting
to Rs. 17,080.
Cash used in financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2012 was Rs. 17,397 as against Rs. 26,378 for the year ended
March 31, 201 1. This decrease is primarily due to net proceeds from loans and borrowings amounting to Rs. 712 and payment of dividend
amounting to Rs. 17,229.
On April 19, 2013, our Board proposed a cash dividend of Rs. 5 (US$0.09) per equity share and ADR. The proposal is subject to the
approval of shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting, and if approved, would result in a cash outflow of approximately Rs. 14,408,
including corporate dividend tax thereon.
We maintain a debt/borrowing level that we have established through consideration of a number of factors including cash flow
expectations, cash required for operations and investment plans. We continually monitor our funding requirements, and strategies are executed
to maintain suf ficient flexibility to access global funding sources, as needed. Please refer to Note 13 of our Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional details on our borrowings.
As discussed above, cash generated from operations is our primary source of liquidity . We believe that our cash and cash equivalents
along with cash generated from operations will be suf ficient to meet our working capital requirements as well as repayment obligations in
respect of debt / borrowings.
As of March 31, 2013, we had contractual commitments of Rs. 1,259 (US$ 23) related to capital expenditures on construction or
expansion of software development facilities, Rs. 1 1,785 (US$ 216) related to non-cancelable operating lease obligations and Rs. 6,272
(US$1 16) related to other purchase obligations. Plans to construct or expand our software development facilities are dictated by business
requirements.
In relation to our acquisitions, a portion of the purchase consideration is payable upon achievement of specified earnings tar gets in the
future. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents, investments in liquid and short-term mutual funds and the cash flows expected to be
generated from our operations in the future will generally be suf ficient to fund the earn-out payments and our expansion plans.
In the normal course of business, we transfer accounts receivables, net investment in sale-type finance receivable and employee
advances (financial assets). Please refer Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our liquidity and capital requirements are af fected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our
businesses and some of which arise from uncertainties related to global economies and the markets that we tar get for our services. We cannot
be certain that additional financing, if needed, will be available on favorable terms, if at all.
As of March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013, our cash and cash equivalents were primarily held in Indian rupees, U.S. dollars,
pound sterling, euros, Japanese yen, Singapore dollars and Saudi riyals. Please refer to “Financial risk management” under Note 16 of our
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on our treasury activities.

Resear ch and Development
Research and Development investment is directed towards developing solutions that have broad applications across various industry
segments and developing expertise in emer ging technologies. Our Research and Development focus is to strengthen the portfolio of Applied
Research, Centers of Excellence (CoE), cloud, mobility , analytics, Solution Accelerators and Software Engineering Tools & Methodologies.
Our activities in Applied Research are focused on inclusive innovation which is aimed at discovering where and how Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) can address ef fective delivery of government to citizen (G2C) and business to business (B2B) services to
rural citizens in education, health, agriculture and rural development sectors.
CoE’ s goal is to create competencies in emer ging areas of technologies and industry domain and incubate new practices for business
growth. Big data, machine to machine, natural user experience, web science and nano electronics were the technology themes identified for
the year and investments in these technology themes have resulted in development of industry application prototypes in the area of augmented
reality , sensor networks and big data visualization.
The Integrated Cloud Services (ICS) group provides end-to-end business solutions to customers using cloud technologies. We focused
on creating industry relevant vertical cloud solutions for the various industries by building a strong value network of partners, creating IP ,
frameworks and accelerators.
We continue to invest in reusable IP  and solution accelerators (components, tools, frameworks) which help in accelerating the
implementation of solutions in customer engagements. We have integrated various accelerator assets to create integrated stacks and solution.
We continue to invest in in-house development of software engineering tools to improve productivity and quality . These tools have
been widely deployed across our business segments. We have also developed a tool called Wipro Portfolio Analysis Tool (P AT) for use in
transition services. We have also developed a tool for flex delivery for managed services for ef fective queue, capacity , and productivity
management at reduced cost. We have developed an in-house Known Error Data Base (KEDB) tool that will help in faster ticket resolution in
managed services projects.
Our research and development expenses for the years ended March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013 were Rs. 1,631, Rs. 1,866 and Rs. 2,196
respectively for our continuing operations.

Trend Information
IT Services. The realm of Information Technology (IT) is a fast changing one. IT  is setting the pace at which the world around us is
changing. At the turn of the first decade of the 21  century , the challenges and opportunities facing the customers and consumers of IT  are very
different than what they were a decade ago. As the world becomes a web of connected devices and better tools are available for making better
decisions, the world is looking to leverage and integrate technology more than ever before.
There continues to be a high level of global economic uncertainty and volatility , driven by high levels of sovereign debt and
unemployment, particularly in Europe and the U.S. However , there is also more stability in customer or ganizations and the demand for IT
services is growing. Customer or ganizations are re-aligning their budgets to be more dominated by business users as customers use IT  to
differentiate themselves in the market place.
In this rapidly evolving and growing environment, we expect increased competition among IT  companies, which may limit our ability
to increase prices. However , we continually strive to dif ferentiate ourselves from the competition and sustain prices and profits by developing
innovative service delivery models, providing better industry solutions, adopting new pricing strategies and demonstrating our value
proposition to clients. We have also acquired businesses to augment our existing services and capabilities.
Gross profit as a percentage of revenue in our IT  Services segment for the year ended March 31, 2013 is 33.37%. We anticipate
difficulties in significantly improving our gross profits lar gely due to the following reasons:
 
 • Our limited ability to increase prices;
 
 • Increases in salaries, a cost which accounts for a major part of our expense line; and
 
 • The impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our rupee realizations.
In response to the possible reduction in demand for IT  services, pressure on gross mar gins and the increased competition from other
IT services companies, we are focusing on:
 
 • Investing in customer relationship teams to establish deeper client relationships and provide a wider range of services;
 
 • Strengthening our delivery model;
 
 • Developing cost containment initiatives and driving higher employee productivity;
 
 • Aligning our resources to expected demand; and
 
 • Increasing the utilization of our IT  professionals.
IT Products. In our IT  Products business segment, we have experienced pricing pressures due to increased competition among IT
companies. Lar ge multinational corporations like IBM, HP  and Dell have identified India as a key focus area. Our gross mar gin in this
business segment is also impacted by the proportion of our business derived from the sale of traded and manufactured products.
Our IT  Products business segment is also subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our revenue in this business segment is driven by the
capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our clients, who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to tax depreciation
benefits on capital equipment.
Our quarterly revenue, operating income and profit for the period have varied significantly in the past and we expect that they are
likely to vary in the future. You should not rely on our quarterly operating results as an indication of future performance. Such quarterly
fluctuations may have an impact on the price of our equity shares and ADSs.
Dividends. Final dividends on common stock are recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the stockholders and interim
dividends are recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the board of directors.
New accounting standards adopted
We adopted an amendment to IFRS 7 “Disclosur es – T ransfers of financial assets” (‘IFRS 7’) ef fective April 1, 2012 . The purpose of
the amendment is to enhance the existing disclosures in IFRS 7 when an asset is transferred but is not derecognized and introduce new
disclosures for assets that are derecognized but the entity continues to have a continuing exposure to the asset after the sale. Adoption of
amendment to IFRS 7 did not have a material ef fect on these condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

New accounting standards not yet adopted
In December , 201 1, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 7 “Disclosur es – offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities”.  The
amended standard requires additional disclosures where financial assets and financial liabilities are of fset in the balance sheet. These
disclosures would provide users with information that is useful in (a) evaluating the ef fect or potential ef fect of netting arrangements on an
entity’ s financial position and (b) analyzing and comparing financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRSs and U.S. GAAP . The
amendment is ef fective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Earlier application is permitted. We have
evaluated the requirements of IFRS 7 and these requirements are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements.
In November 2009, the IASB issued the chapter of IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments r elating to the classification and measur ement of
financial assets” . The new standard represents the first phase of a three-phase project to replace IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measur ement”  (IAS 39) with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9). IFRS 9 uses a single approach to determine whether a financial
asset is measured at amortized cost or fair value, replacing the many dif ferent rules in IAS 39. The approach in IFRS 9 is based on how an
entity manages its financial assets (its business model) and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. In October 2010,
the IASB added the requirement relating to classification and measurement of financial liabilities to IFRS 9. Under the amendment, an entity
measuring its financial liability at fair value, can present the amount of fair value change in the liability attributable to change in the liabilities
credit risk in other comprehensive income. Further the IASB also decided to carry-forward unchanged from IAS 39 requirements relating to
de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 is ef fective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2015. Earlier
application is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact these amendments will have on the Company’ s consolidated financial
statements.
In May 201 1, the IASB issued IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” . The new standard establishes principles for the
presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity controls one or more other entities. IFRS 10 replaces the
consolidation requirements in SIC-12 “Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities”  and IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial
Statements”. IFRS 10 builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should
be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company . The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the
determination of control where this is dif ficult to assess. IFRS 10 is ef fective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Earlier
application is permitted. We have evaluated the requirements of IFRS 10 and these requirements are not expected to have a material impact on
the consolidated financial statements.
In May 201 1, the IASB issued IFRS 13 “Fair V alue Measur ement” . The new standard defines fair value, sets out in a single IFRS a
framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. IFRS 13 applies when other IFRSs require or
permit fair value measurements. It does not introduce any new requirements to measure an asset or a liability at fair value or change what is
measured at fair value in IFRSs or address how to present changes in fair value. IFRS 13 is ef fective for fiscal years beginning on or after
January 1, 2013. Early application is permitted. We have evaluated the requirements of IFRS 13 and these requirements are not expected to
have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In June 201 1, the IASB issued Amendment to IAS 1 “Pr esentation of Financial Statements”  that will improve and align the
presentation of items of other comprehensive income (OCI) in financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The amendments require companies preparing financial statements in accordance with IFRSs to group together
items within OCI that may be reclassified to the profit or loss section of the income statement. The amendments will also reaf firm existing
requirements that items in OCI and profit or loss should be presented as either a single statement or two consecutive statements. This
amendment is ef fective for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2012. Earlier adoption is permitted. We have evaluated the requirements
of IAS 1and these requirements are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In June 201 1, the IASB issued IAS 19 (Amended) “Employee Benefits” . The new standard has eliminated an option to defer the
recognition of gains and losses through re-measurements and requires such gain or loss to be recognized through other comprehensive income
in the year of occurrence to reduce volatility . The amended standard requires immediate recognition of ef fects of any plan amendments.
Further it also requires return on assets in profit or loss to be restricted to government bond yields or corporate bond yields, considered for
valuation of Projected Benefit Obligation, irrespective of actual portfolio allocations. The actual return from the portfolio in excess of or less
than such yields is recognized through Other Comprehensive Income. The amendment is ef fective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning on
or after January 1, 2013. Earlier adoption is permitted. We have evaluated the requirements of IAS 19 (Amended) and these requirements are
not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In December , 201 1, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 32 “Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities”.  The purpose of
the amendment is to clarify some of the requirements for of fsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on the statements of financial
position. This includes clarifying the meaning of “currently has a legally enforceable right to set-of f” and also the application of the IAS 32
offsetting criteria to settlement systems (such as central clearing house systems) which apply gross settlement mechanisms that are not
simultaneous. The amendment is ef fective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. Earlier application is
permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact these amendments will have on the Company’ s consolidated financial statements.
In May 2012, the IASB issued IFRS 12 “Disclosur e of Inter ests in Other Entities” . This standard provides comprehensive disclosure
requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose. The objective of the standard
is to enable the entities to disclose the significant judgement and assumptions it has made in determining:
 
 i) the nature of its interest in another entity or arrangement, i.e control, joint control or significant influence.
 
 ii) The type of joint arrangement when the joint arrangement is structured through separate vehicle.
IFRS 12 is ef fective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Early application is permitted. We have evaluated the
requirements of IFRS 12 and these requirements are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Critical accounting policies
Critical accounting policies are defined as those that in our view are the most important for portrayal of the Company’ s financial
condition and results and which place the most significant demands on management’ s judgment. For a detailed discussion on the application
of these and other accounting policies, please refer to Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
While preparing financial statements we make estimates and assumptions that af fect the reported amount of assets, liabilities,
disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for the reporting
period. Such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and have a material impact on the Company’ s results of
operation, financial position and cash flows. Actual results may dif fer from estimates. Revision to accounting estimates are recognized in the
period in which the estimate is revised and for future periods af fected.
Revenue:
We derive revenue primarily from:
 
 • Software development and maintenance services;
 
 • BPO services; and
 
 • Sale of IT  and other products.
 
 a) Services: We recognize revenue when the significant terms of the arrangement are enforceable, services are being delivered and
collectability is reasonably assured. The method for recognizing revenues and costs depends on the nature of the services rendered:
 
 (i) Time and materials contracts: Revenues and costs relating to time and materials contracts are recognized as the
related services are rendered.
 
 (ii) Fixed-price contracts: Revenues from fixed-price contracts, including systems development and integration contracts
are recognized using the “percentage-of-completion” method. Percentage of completion is determined based on direct
project costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated project costs required to complete the project. The cost
expended (or input) method has been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship
between input and productivity . Costs which relate to future activity on the contract are recognized as contract work in
progress. If we do not have a suf ficient basis to measure the progress of completion or to estimate the total contract
revenues and costs, revenue is recognized only to the extent of contract cost incurred for which recoverability is
probable. When total cost estimates exceed revenues in an arrangement, the estimated losses are recognized in the
income statement in the period in which such losses become probable based on the current contract estimates.
“Unbilled revenues” represent cost and earnings in excess of billings as at the end of the reporting period. “Unearned
revenues” included in other current liabilities represent billing in excess of revenue recognized.

 (iii) Maintenance contract: Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the period of the contract
using the percentage of completion method. When services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive
acts over a specified period of time, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the specified period unless
some other method better represents the stage of completion.
In certain projects, a fixed quantum of service or output units is agreed at a fixed price for a fixed term. In such
contracts, revenue is recognized with respect to the actual output achieved to date as a percentage of total contractual
output. Any residual service unutilized by the customer is recognized as revenue on completion of the term.
 
 b) Products: Revenue from products are recognized when:
 
 • we have transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer;
 
 • continuing managerial involvement usually associated with ownership and ef fective control have ceased;
 
 • amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
 
 •  it is probable that economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company; and
 
 • costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably .
 
 c) Multiple element arrangements: We allocate revenue to each separately identifiable component of the transaction based on the
guidance in IAS 18. We allocate the arrangement consideration to separately identifiable components based on their relative fair
values or on the residual method. Fair values are determined based on sale prices for the components when it is regularly sold
separately , third-party prices for similar components or on a cost plus basis or an appropriate business-specific profit mar gin related
to the relevant component.
 
 d) Others: We account for volume discounts and pricing incentives to customers by reducing the amount of discount from the amount
of revenue recognized at the time of sale.
Revenues are shown net of sales tax, value added tax, service tax and applicable discounts and allowances. Revenue includes
excise duty and shipping and handling costs.
Income tax:
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognized in profit or loss except to the extent it relates to
items directly recognized in equity , in which case it is recognized in equity .
 
 a) Curr ent income tax:  As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our
income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are subject to tax assessments in each of these jurisdictions. A tax
assessment can involve complex issues, which can only be resolved over extended time periods. Though we have considered all
these issues in estimating our income taxes, there could be an unfavorable resolution of such issues that may af fect results of our
operations.
Current income tax for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the
taxation authorities based on the taxable income for that period. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amounts are those
that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
 
 b) Deferr ed income tax: We recognize deferred income tax using the balance sheet approach. Deferred tax is recognized on temporary
differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting
purposes. We recognize a deferred tax asset only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the deductible temporary dif ferences and tax loss carry forwards can be utilized.
The measurement of deferred tax assets involves judgment regarding the deductibility of costs not yet subject to taxation and
estimates regarding suf ficient future taxable income to enable utilization of unused tax losses in dif ferent tax jurisdictions. We
consider the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. All
deferred tax assets are subject to review of probable utilization.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is
realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting
date.
We recognize deferred income tax liabilities for all taxable temporary dif ferences except in respect of taxable temporary
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates where the timing of the reversal of the temporary dif ference
can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary dif ference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

 c) Others: In addition to the U.S. federal income tax, which can tax at a rate of up to 35% arising from our income attributed to our
U.S. branch, we are subject to a 15% branch profit tax in the United States on the “dividend equivalent amount” as that term is
defined under U.S. tax law . We have not triggered the branch profit tax and, consistent with our business plan, we intend to
maintain the current level of our net assets in the United States and therefore remain below the threshold. Accordingly , we did not
record a provision for branch profit tax as of March 31, 2013.
Share based payment transaction:
Our employees receive remuneration in the form of equity instruments issued pursuant to various employee stock option and
restricted stock unit option plans for rendering services over a defined vesting period. Equity instruments granted are valued at the fair value of
the instrument at the date of grant. Since these are granted at a nominal exercise price, the intrinsic value on the date of grant approximates the
fair value. The expense is recorded by a compensating increase to the share based payment reserve, a component of equity .
The equity instruments generally vest in a graded manner over the vesting period. The fair value determined at the grant date is
expensed over the vesting period of respective tranches (accelerated amortization). The stock compensation expense is determined based on
our estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
In accounting for amortization of stock compensation, we also estimate stock option forfeitures. Any revisions of our estimates could
impact our results of operations and our financial position.
Derivative financial instruments
Although our functional currency is the Indian rupee, we transact a significant portion of our business in foreign currencies,
particularly the U.S. dollar . The exchange rate between the rupee and the dollar has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate
substantially in the future. Consequently , the results of our operations are af fected as the rupee fluctuates against the U.S. dollar . Our exchange
rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues, cash balances, payables and debt. We enter into derivative instruments to
primarily hedge our forecasted cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies, foreign currency debt and net investment in overseas
operations.
Changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging derivatives and inef fective portions of the hedging instruments are
recognized in consolidated statements of income of each period. We assess the hedge ef fectiveness at the end of each reporting period
generally using the dollar of fset method.
Hedge inef fectiveness could result from forecasted transactions not happening in the same amounts or in the same periods as
forecasted or changes in the counterparty credit rating. Further , changes in the basis of designating derivatives as hedges of forecasted
transactions could alter the proportion of derivatives which are inef fective as hedges. Hedge inef fectiveness increases volatility of the
consolidated statements of income since the changes in fair value of an inef fective portion of derivatives is immediately recognized in the
consolidated statements of income.
As of March 31, 2013, there were no significant gains or losses on derivative transactions or portions thereof that have become
ineffective as hedges or associated with an underlying exposure that did not occur .
Derivatives are recognized initially at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in the statement of income when
incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described below .
 
 a) Cash flow hedges:  Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are
recognized directly in equity to the extent that the hedge is ef fective. To the extent that the hedge is inef fective, changes in
fair value are recognized in the statement of income. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively . The cumulative
gain or loss previously recognized in equity is transferred to the consolidated statement of income upon the occurrence of
the forecasted transaction.
 
 b) Hedges of net investment in for eign operations: We designate derivative financial instruments as hedges of net investments
in foreign operations. We have also designated a combination of foreign currency denominated borrowings and related cross
currency swaps as hedge of net investment in foreign operations. Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging
instrument and gains/losses on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated borrowings designated as hedge of
net investment in foreign operations are recognized directly in equity to the extent that the hedge is ef fective. The
cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in equity is transferred to the statement of income upon sale or disposal of the
related net investment in foreign operation. To the extent that the hedge is inef fective, changes in fair value are recognized
in the statement of income.

 c) Others: Changes in fair value for derivatives not designated as hedging derivatives are recognized in consolidated
statements of income of each period.
Business combination, goodwill and intangible assets:
 
 a) Business combination:  Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of
exchange. We exercise judgment in identifying whether an identifiable intangible asset is to be recorded separately from
goodwill. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
measured initially at fair values at the date of an acquisition, based on information available at the acquisition date and
based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Transaction costs incurred in
connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
The cost of an acquisition also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Any subsequent changes to the fair
value of contingent consideration classified as liabilities are recognized in the consolidated statement of income.
 
 b) Goodwill:  Goodwill is initially measured at cost, calculated the excess of the cost of the business combination over the
Company’ s share in the net fair value of the acquiree’ s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the cost of
an acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the business acquired, the dif ference is recognized immediately
in the income statement.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test is performed at
the level of the cash-generating unit or groups of cash-generating units which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is
monitored for internal management purposes.
We use market related information and estimates (generally risk adjusted discounted cash flows) to determine the fair
values. Cash flow projections take into account past experience and represent management’ s best estimate about future
developments. Key assumptions on which management has based its determination of fair value less costs to sell and value
in use include estimated growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and tax rates. These estimates, including the
methodology used, can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any goodwill
impairment, if any .
 
 c) Intangible Assets:  Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible
assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of an acquisition. Following initial recognition,
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life and assessed for impairment whenever there is
an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization of an intangible asset with a finite useful life
reflects the manner in which the economic benefit is expected to be generated and consumed. These estimates are reviewed
at least at each financial year end. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment
at least annually and written down to the fair value as required.
The estimated useful lives of the amortizable intangibles assets are as follows:
 
Category   Useful life
Customer -related intangibles  2 to 1 1 years
Marketing related intangibles   20 to 30 years
Other estimates:
We make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical payment patterns, customer
concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends. If the financial condition of a customer deteriorates, additional
allowances may be required.
We provide for inventory obsolescence, excess inventory and inventories with carrying values in excess of market values based on our
assessment of the future demands, market conditions and our specific inventory management initiatives. If market conditions and actual
demands are less favorable than our estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. In all cases inventory is carried at the lower
of historical cost or market value.

Goodwill Impairment T esting
We test goodwill and indefinite life intangibles for impairment annually in accordance with our procedure for determining the
recoverable value of such assets. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit (“CGU”) representing
the lowest level within the group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and which is not higher than the group’ s
operating segment. The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell (“FVLCTS”) and its value-in-use
(“VIU”). The FVLCTS of the CGU is determined based on the market capitalization approach, using the turnover and earnings multiples
derived from observed market data. The VIU is determined based on discounted cash flow projections. Key assumptions used by us to
determine the VIUs include:
 
 a) Estimated cash flows for five years based on formal/approved internal management budgets with extrapolation for the
remaining period, wherever such budgets were shorter than a 5 year period.
 
 b) Terminal value arrived by extrapolating the last forecasted year cash flows to perpetuity using long-term growth rates of 2%
to 6%. These long-term growth rates take into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data. The long-term growth
rates used do not exceed that of the relevant business and industry sector .
 
 c) The discount rates used are based on our weighted average cost of capital as an approximation of the weighted average cost
of capital of a comparable market participant, which are adjusted for specific country risks by 10% to 15.5%.
 
 d) Value-in-use is calculated using after tax assumptions. The use of after tax assumptions does not result in a value-in-use that
is materially dif ferent from the value-in-use that would result if the calculation was performed using before tax
assumptions. The after tax discount rate used ranges from 10% to 16%. The before tax discount rate is determined based on
the value-in-use derived from the use of after tax assumptions, and ranges from 1 1.7% to 23.1%.
Based on the above, no impairment was identified as of March 31, 2013, as the recoverable value of the CGUs exceeded the carrying
value. Further , none of the CGU’ s tested for impairment as of March 31, 2013 was at risk of impairment. An analysis of the calculation’ s
sensitivity to a change in the key parameters (revenue growth, operating mar gin, discount rate and long term growth rate) based on reasonably
probable assumptions, did not identify any probable scenarios where the CGU’ s recoverable amount would fall below its carrying amount.

March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013, more than 20,000, 20,000, and 25,000 of these employees were located outside India, respectively . Highly
trained and motivated people are critical to the success of our business. To achieve this, we focus on attracting and retaining the best people
possible. A combination of a strong brand name, a congenial working environment and competitive compensation programs enable us to
attract and retain these talented people.
Our human resources department is centralized at our corporate headquarters in Bangalore and functions across all of our business
segments. We have implemented corporate-wide recruiting, training, performance evaluation and compensation programs that are tailored to
address the needs of each of our business segments.
Our relationship with employees and employee groups are based on mutual trust and respect and our goal is to maintain this spirit at
all times. We continue to fulfill all requirements and commitments which could arise out of collective bar gaining as required across various
development centers and manufacturing facilities and other such agreements in specific geographies across the Americas, Europe and Asia.
Recruiting
We hire entry level graduates from both the top engineering and management universities in India, as well as more experienced lateral
hires through employee referral programs, advertisements, placement consultants, our website postings and walk-ins. To facilitate employee
growth within the Company , all new openings are first of fered to our current employees. The job description, skill set requirements and

their new roles.
Training
Each of our new recruits must attend an eight week intensive training program when they begin working with us. New or recent
graduates must also attend additional training programs that are tailored to their area of technology . We also have a mandatory continuing

Compensation
We continually strive to provide our employees with competitive and innovative compensation packages. Our compensation packages
include a combination of salary , stock options, pension, and health and disability insurance. We measure our compensation packages against
industry standards and seek to match or exceed them. We adopted an employee stock purchase plan in 1984, employee stock option plan in
1999 and 2000 and restricted stock unit option plan in 2004, 2005 and 2007. We have devised both business segment performance and
individual performance linked incentive programs that we believe more accurately link performance to compensation for each employee. For
example, for our managerial team, we link cash compensation to their business segment’ s actual quarterly performance against its planned
financial tar gets.

EMPLOYEE ST OCK OPTION PLANS
We have various employee stock option and restricted stock unit option plans (collectively referred to as “stock option plans”). Our
stock option plans provide for grants of options to eligible employees and directors. Our stock option plans are administered by our Board
Governance, Nomination and Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) appointed by our Board of Directors. The Committee has the sole
power to determine the terms of the units granted, including the exercise price, selection of eligible employees and directors, the number of
equity shares to be covered by each option, the vesting and exercise periods, and the form of consideration payable upon such exercise. In
addition, the Committee has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate the stock plan with the approval of the shareholders, provided that
no such action may adversely af fect the rights of any participant under the plan.
Our stock option plan generally does not allow for the transfer of options and only the optionee may exercise an option during his or
her lifetime. The vesting period for the options under the stock option plans range from 12 months to a maximum of 84 months. An optionee
generally must exercise any vested options within a prescribed period as per the respective stock option plans generally before the termination
date of the stock option plan. A participant must exercise any vested options prior to termination of services with us or within a specified post-
separation period ranging from seven days to six months from the date of the separation , depending on the reason for separation. If an
optionee’ s termination is due to death, disability or retirement, his or her option will fully vest and become exercisable.
In connection with the Demer ger and pursuant to the Scheme, each optionee received an additional one employee stock option for
every 8.25 employee stock options held as of the Record Date of the Demer ger.

Wipro Equity Reward Trust
We established the Wipro Equity Reward Trust, or WER T, in 1984 to allow our employees to acquire a greater proprietary stake in our
success and growth, and to encourage our employees to continue their association with us. The WER T, which is administered by a Board of
Trustees is designed to give eligible employees the right to receive restricted shares and other compensation benefits at the times and on the
conditions that we specify . Such compensation benefits include voluntary contributions, loans, interest and dividends on investments in the
WER T and other similar benefits.
Shares from the WER T are issued in the joint names of the WER T and the employee until such restrictions and obligations are
fulfilled by the employee. After the four -year vesting period, complete ownership of the shares is transferred to the employee.
If employment is terminated due to death or disability or retirement, the employee’ s restricted shares are transferred to his or her legal
heirs or continue to be held by the employee, as applicable, and such individuals may exercise any rights to those shares for up to ninety days
after employment has ceased. The Trustees of the WER T have the authority to amend or terminate the WER T at any time and for any reason.

Shareholders have, through a postal ballot, approved the issuance of additional shares, in one or more tranches, to the WER T. The
Board has the discretion to determine the timing and allotment of such shares, and as of March 31, 2013 has not approved the issuance of

Major  Shar eholders
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our equity shares as of March 31, 2013, of
each person or group known by us to own beneficially 5% or more of our outstanding equity shares.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and includes voting and investment power with respect to
such shares. Shares subject to vested options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of March 31, 2013, are deemed to be
outstanding or to be beneficially owned by the person holding such options for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of such
person, but are not deemed to be outstanding or to be beneficially owned for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other
person. All information with respect to the beneficial ownership of any principal shareholder has been furnished by such shareholder and,
unless otherwise indicated below , we believe that persons named in the table have sole voting and sole investment power with respect to all
the shares shown as beneficially owned, subject to community property laws, where applicable. The Demer ger of the Diversified Business,
effective as of March 31, 2013, had no impact on the number of Wipro equity shares outstanding. The number of shares and percentage
ownership are based on 2,462,934,730 equity shares outstanding as of March 31, 2013.

Wipro Trademarks Holding Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company , owns certain trademarks that are used both by

Legal Pr oceedings
Please also see the section titled “Legal Proceedings” under Item 4 of this Annual Report for this information.
Dividends
Public companies in India typically pay cash dividends even though the amount of such dividends varies from company to company .
Under Indian law , a corporation can pay dividends upon a recommendation by the Board of Directors and approval by a majority of the
shareholders, who have the right to decrease but not increase the amount of the dividend recommended by the Board of Directors. Under the
Indian Companies Act, 1956, dividends may be paid out of profits of a company in the year in which the dividend is declared or out of the
undistributed profits of previous fiscal years.
During fiscal year 2013, we paid a cash dividend of Rs. 6 per share, including an interim dividend of Rs. 2 per share.
Pursuant to the Scheme, each holder of Wipro equity shares were entitled to one equity share of the Resulting Company , or its
equivalent, for every five equity shares of Wipro held by such holder . Certain Wipro shareholders also had their shares of the Resulting
Company exchanged for equity shares of Wipro (the “Share Exchange”), at a ratio of one equity share of Wipro for every one and sixty five
hundredths (1.65) equity shares of the Resulting Company . The additional shares of Wipro issued to the shareholders in the Share Exchange
are treated as a dividend for US federal tax purposes for the ADR holders and shareholders. Please also see the section entitled “Material
United States Federal Income Tax Consequences” in Item 10 for additional information on the tax treatment of the Demer ger.
On April 19 2013, we proposed to pay a final cash dividend of Rs. 5 (US$ 0.09) per share on our equity shares and ADRs. This
proposal is subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company . We expect a dividend payout (including dividend tax) of approximately
Rs. 14,408 million.
Although we have no current intention to discontinue dividend payments, we cannot assure you that any future dividends will be
declared or paid or that the amount thereof will not be decreased. Holders of ADSs will be entitled to receive dividends payable on equity
shares represented by such ADSs. Cash dividends on equity shares represented by ADSs are paid to the Depositary in rupees and are generally
converted by the Depositary into U.S. dollars and distributed, net of depositary fees, taxes, if any , and expenses, to the holders of such ADSs.
Significant Changes
None.

Trading Practices and Pr ocedur es on the Indian Stock Exchanges
The BSE and NSE (the “ Exchanges ”) together account for a majority of the total trading volume on the Indian Stock Exchanges.
Trading on both of these exchanges is accomplished on electronic trading platforms. Trading is done on a two-day fixed settlement basis on all
of the exchanges. Any outstanding amount at the end of the settlement period is settled by delivery and payment. However , institutional
investors are not permitted to ‘net out’  their transactions and must trade on a delivery basis.
Orders can be entered with a specified term of validity that may last until the end of the session, day or settlement period. Dealers
must specify whether orders are for a proprietary account or for a client. The Exchanges specify certain mar gin requirements for trades
executed on the exchange, including mar gins based on the volume or quantity of exposure that the broker has on the market, as well as
market-to-market mar gins payable on a daily basis for all outstanding trades. Trading on the Exchanges normally takes place from 09:00 a.m.
to 3:30 p.m. on all weekdays, except holidays. The Exchanges do not permit carry forward trades. They have separate mar gin requirements
based on the net exposure of the broker on the exchange. Exchanges also have separate online trading systems and separate clearing houses.
The BSE and NSE were closed on a few occasions, in the interest of protection of investor interests, due to fluctuation in prices
caused by various events. On January 22, 2008, the market tumbled in opening trade due to panic selling triggering the market wide circuit
filter after the intra-day 10% fall. On November 27, 2008, due to terrorist attacks in the city of Mumbai, the BSE and NSE were closed. On
May 18, 2009, circuit filters were breached twice during the day and the market closed for the day upon reaching the 20% trigger point. When
the markets hit the upper circuit limit on May 18, 2009, there was just a mar ginal fall in the index the following day .
The stock exchanges in India now operate on a trading day plus two, or T+2 rolling settlement systems. At the end of the T+2 period,
obligations are settled with buyers of securities paying for and receiving securities, while sellers transfer and receive payment for securities.
The SEBI has moved to a T+2 settlement system, and is subsequently planning to move to a T+1 settlement system.
In order to contain the risk arising out of the transactions entered into by the members in various securities either on their own account
or on behalf of their clients, the lar gest exchanges have designed risk management procedures, which include compulsory prescribed mar gins
on the individual broker members, based on their outstanding exposure in the market, as well as stock specific mar gins from the members.
There are generally no restrictions on price movements of any security on any given day . In order to restrict abnormal price volatility , SEBI
has instructed the stock exchanges to apply the following price bands, calculated at the previous day’ s closing price as follows:
Market-wide circuit breakers are applied to the market for movements by 10%, 15% and 20% for two prescribed market indices; the
SENSEX for the BSE and the Nifty for the NSE. If any of these circuit breaker thresholds are reached, trading on all equity and equity
derivates markets nationwide is halted. This circuit breaker brings about a coordinated trading halt in all equity and equity derivative markets
nationwide. The market wide circuit breakers would be triggered by movement of either SENSEX or the NSE S&P  CNX Nifty whichever is
breached earlier . In case of a 10% movement of either of these indices, there would be a 1-hour market halt if the movement takes place before
1 p.m. In case the movement takes place at or after 1 p.m. but before 2:30 p.m. there will be a trading halt for half an hour . In case the
movement takes place at or after 2:30 p.m. there will be no trading halt at the 10% level and the market will continue trading. If there is a 15%
movement of either index, there will be a 2-hour market halt if the movement takes place before 1 p.m. If the 15% trigger is reached on or
after 1 p.m. but before 2 p.m., there will be a 1 hour halt. If the 15% trigger is reached on or after 2 p.m. the trading will halt for the remainder
of the day . In case of a 20% movement of the index, the trading will be halted for the remainder of the day . The percentages are calculated on
the closing index value of the quarter . These percentages are translated into absolute points of index variations (rounded of f to the nearest 25
points in case of SENSEX). At the end of each quarter , these absolute points of index variations are revised and made applicable for the next
quarter .
Index based market wide cir cuit br eaker
The Exchange implements, on a quarterly basis, the index based market wide circuit breaker system. The system is applicable at three
stages of the index movement either way at 10%, 15% and 20%.
Listing
The SEBI has promulgated regulations for listing and is governed through circulars issued from time to time by amending the Listing
Agreement entered into by listed companies with stock exchanges. The Stock Exchanges monitor the listed companies under the supervision
of SEBI.

depositary-enabled trades. The NSE has approximately 1,500 members.

existing stock exchange. The derivative exchange or derivative segment of a stock exchange functions as a self-regulatory or ganization under
the supervision of the SEBI.
Depositories
The National Securities Depository Limited and Central Depositary Services (India) Limited are the two depositories that provide
electronic depositary facilities for trading in equity and debt securities in India. The SEBI mandates that a company making a public or rights
issue or an of fer for sale to enter into an agreement with a depository for dematerialization of securities already issued or proposed to be issued
to the public or existing shareholders. The SEBI has also provided that the issue and allotment of shares in initial public of ferings and/or the
trading of shares shall only be in electronic form.

Description of Equity Shar es
Dividends
Under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, unless our Board of Directors recommends the payment of a dividend we may not declare a
dividend. Similarly , under our Articles of Association, although the shareholders may , at the Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders,
approve a dividend in an amount less than that recommended by the Board of Directors, they cannot increase the amount of the dividend. In
India, dividends are declared as a fixed sum per share on the company’ s equity shares. The dividend recommended by the Board, if any , and
subject to the limitations described above, is distributed and paid to shareholders in proportion to the paid up value of their shares within 30
days of the approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Pursuant to our Articles of Association, our Board of Directors has
discretion to declare and pay interim dividends without shareholder approval. Under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, read with the listing
agreements entered into with Indian stock exchanges, dividends can only be paid in cash to the registered shareholder at a record date fixed on
or prior to the Annual General Meeting or to his order or his banker ’s order .
The Companies Act provides that any dividends that remain unpaid or unclaimed are to be transferred to the Investor Education and
Protection Fund created by the Indian Government after the stipulated time. Under the Companies Act, dividends may be paid out of profits of
a company in the year in which the dividend is declared or out of the undistributed profits of previous fiscal years subject to transfer of such
portion. Before declaring a dividend greater than 10% of the par value of its equity shares, a company is required under the Companies Act to
transfer to its reserves a minimum percentage of its profits for that year , ranging from 2.5% to 10%, depending upon the dividend percentage
to be declared in such year .
The Companies Act further provides that, in the event of an inadequacy or absence of profits in any year , a dividend may be declared
for such year out of the company’ s accumulated profits, subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions.
We are subject to taxation for each dividend declared, distributed or paid for a relevant period by our company .
Bonus Shar es
In addition to permitting dividends to be paid out of current or retained earnings as described above, the Companies Act permits a
company to distribute an amount transferred from the general reserve or other permitted reserves, including share premium account and
surplus in the company’ s statement of profit and loss account, to its shareholders in the form of bonus shares, which are similar to a stock
dividend. Bonus shares are distributed to shareholders in the proportion recommended by the Board of Directors to such shareholders of
record on a fixed record date when they are entitled to receive such bonus shares.
Audit and Annual Report
At least twenty one days before the Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders (excluding the days of mailing and date of the
meeting), we must distribute to our shareholders our audited Indian GAAP  balance sheet and statement of profit and loss account and the
related reports of our Board of Directors and the Auditors, together with a notice convening the Annual General Meeting. SEBI has permitted
distribution of abridged financial statements to shareholders in India in lieu of complete versions of financial statements. Under the Companies
Act, a company must file the balance sheet and annual statement of profit and loss account presented to the shareholders within 30 days of the
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting with the Registrar of Companies.
A company must also file an annual return containing a list of the company’ s shareholders and other company information within 60
days of the conclusion of the meeting.
Consolidation and Subdivision of Shar es
The Indian Companies Act permits a company to split or combine the par value of its shares, provided such split or combination is not
made in fractions. Shareholders of record on a fixed record date are entitled to receive the split or combination shares.
Preemptive Rights, Issue of Additional Shar es and Distribution of Rights
The Companies Act gives shareholders the right to subscribe for new shares in proportion to their respective existing shareholdings
unless otherwise determined by a special resolution passed by a general meeting of the shareholders, and the right to renounce such
subscription right in favor of any other person. Holders of ADSs may not be permitted to participate in any such of fer.
If we ever plan to distribute additional rights to purchase our equity shares, we will give prior written notice to the Depositary and we
will assist the Depositary in determining whether it is lawful and reasonably practicable to distribute rights to purchase additional ADSs to
holders.

The Depositary will establish procedures to distribute rights to purchase additional ADSs to holders and to enable such holders to
exercise such rights if it is lawful and reasonably practicable to make the rights available to holders of ADSs, subject to all of the
documentation contemplated in the deposit agreement (such as opinions to address the lawfulness of the transaction). You may have to pay
fees, expenses, taxes and other governmental char ges to subscribe for the new ADSs upon the exercise of your rights. The Depositary is not
obligated to establish procedures to facilitate the distribution and exercise by holders of rights to purchase new equity shares directly , rather
than new ADSs.
The Depositary will not distribute the rights to you if:
 
 • we do not timely request that the rights be distributed to you or we request that the rights not be distributed to you;
 
 • we fail to deliver satisfactory documents to the Depositary; or
 
 • it is not reasonably practicable to distribute the rights.
The Depositary will sell the rights that are not exercised or not distributed if such sale is lawful and reasonably practicable. The
proceeds of such sale will be distributed to holders in the same manner as in cash distribution. If the Depositary is unable to sell the rights, it
will allow the rights to lapse.
Voting Rights
At any general meeting, voting is by show of hands unless a poll is demanded by a shareholder or shareholders present in person or by
proxy holding at least 10% of the total shares entitled to vote on the resolution, or by those holding shares with an aggregate paid up capital of
at least Rs. 50,000. Upon a show of hands, every shareholder entitled to vote and present in person has one vote and, on a poll, every
shareholder entitled to vote and present in person or by proxy has voting rights in proportion to the paid up capital held by such shareholders.
The Chairman of the Board has a deciding vote in the case of any tie. Any shareholder of the company may appoint a proxy . The instrument
appointing a proxy must be delivered to the company at least 48 hours prior to the meeting. A proxy may not vote except on a poll. A corporate
shareholder may appoint an authorized representative who can vote on behalf of the shareholder , both upon a show of hands and upon a poll.
Ordinary resolutions may be passed by simple majority of those present and voting at any general meeting for which the required
period of notice has been given. However , certain resolutions called special resolutions in many circumstances, for example amendments to
the Articles of Association, changes to certain clauses in the Memorandum of Association or the commencement of a new line of business,
require that votes cast in favor of the resolution (whether by show of hands or poll) are not less than three times the number of votes, if any ,
cast against the resolution.
Liquidation Rights
Subject to the rights of creditors, employees and the holders of any shares entitled by their terms to preferential repayment over the
equity shares, if any , in the event of our winding-up, the holders of the equity shares are entitled to be repaid the amounts of paid up capital or
credited as paid up on those equity shares. All surplus assets after payments to the holders of any preference shares at the commencement of
the winding-up shall be paid to holders of equity shares in proportion to their shareholdings.
Preference Shar es
Preference shares have preferential dividend and liquidation rights. Preference shares may be redeemed if they are fully paid, and only
out of our profits, or out of the proceeds of the sale of shares issued for purposes of such redemption. Holders of preference shares do not have
the right to vote at shareholder meetings, except on resolutions which directly af fect the rights of their preference shares. However , holders of
cumulative preference shares have the right to vote on every resolution at any meeting of the shareholders if the dividends due on the
preference shares have not been paid, in whole or in part, for a period of at least two years prior to the date of the meeting. Currently , we have
no preference shares issued and/or outstanding.
Redemption of Equity Shar es
Under the Companies Act, unlike preference shares, equity shares are not redeemable.
Liability on Calls
Not applicable.

Discriminatory Pr ovisions in Articles
There are no provisions in our Articles of Association discriminating against any existing or prospective holder of such securities as a
result of such shareholder owning a substantial number of shares.
Alteration of Shar eholder  Rights
Under the Companies Act, the rights of any class of shareholders can be altered or varied with the consent in writing of the holders of
not less than three-fourths of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the
holders of the issued shares of that class if the provisions with respect to such variation are contained in the Memorandum of Association or
Articles of Association of the Company , or in the absence of any such provision in the Memorandum of Association or Articles of Association,
if such variation is not prohibited by the terms of issue of the shares of that class.
Under the Companies Act, the Articles of Association may be altered only by way of a special resolution.
Meetings of Shar eholders
We must convene an Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders within six months after the end of each fiscal year and may
convene an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders when necessary or at the request of a shareholder or shareholders holding at least
10% of our paid up capital carrying voting rights. The Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders is generally convened by our Secretary
pursuant to a resolution of our Board of Directors. Written notice setting out the agenda of the meeting must be given at least 21 days, either
through electronic communication or hard copy mail, excluding the days of mailing and date of the meeting, prior to the date of the Annual
General Meeting to the shareholders of record. Shareholders who are registered as shareholders on a pre-determined date are entitled to such
notice or their proxies and have a right to attend or vote at such meeting. The Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders must be held at our
registered of fice or at such other place within the city in which the registered of fice is located. Meetings other than the Annual General
Meeting of the Shareholders may be held at any other place if so determined by our Board of Directors. Our Articles of Association provide
that a quorum for an Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders is the presence of at least five shareholders in person.
Additionally , shareholder consent for certain items or special business is required to be obtained by a postal ballot. In order to obtain
the shareholders’  consent, our Board of Directors appoints a scrutinizer , who is not in our employment, who, in the opinion of the Board, can
conduct the postal ballot voting process in a fair and transparent manner in accordance with the provisions of Companies (Passing of the
Resolution by Postal Ballot) Rules, 2001. The Indian Government has recently permitted electronic voting subject to certain conditions.
Limitations on the Rights to Own Securities
The limitations on the rights to own securities imposed by Indian law , including the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to
hold securities, are discussed in Item 10 of this Annual Report, under the section titled “Currency Exchange Controls” and is incorporated
herein by reference.
Voting Rights of Deposited Equity Shar es Repr esented by ADSs
As soon as practicable after receipt of notice of any meetings or solicitation of consents or proxies of holders of shares or other
deposited securities, our Depositary shall fix a record date for determining the holders entitled to give instructions for the exercise of voting
rights. The Depositary shall then mail to the holders of ADSs a notice stating (a) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting
and any solicitation materials, (b) that each holder on the record date set by the Depositary therefore will be entitled to instruct the Depositary
as to the exercise of the voting rights, if any , pertaining to the deposited securities represented by the ADSs evidenced by such holders of
ADRs, and (c) the manner in which such instruction may be given, including instructions to give discretionary proxy to a person designated by
us.
On receipt of the aforesaid notice from the Depositary , our ADS holders may instruct the Depositary on how to exercise the voting
rights for the shares that underlie their ADSs. For such instructions to be valid, the Depositary must receive them on or before a specified date.
The Depositary will make all reasonable ef forts, and subject to the provisions of Indian law , our Memorandum of Association and our
Articles of Association, to vote or to have its agents vote the shares or other deposited securities as per our ADS holders’  instructions. The
Depositary will only vote or attempt to vote as per an ADS holder ’s instructions. The Depositary will not itself exercise any voting discretion.

Neither the Depositary nor its agents are responsible for any failure to carry out any voting instructions, for the manner in which any
vote is cast, or for the ef fect of any vote. There is no guarantee that our shareholders will receive voting materials in time to instruct the
Depositary to vote and it is possible that ADS holders, or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not
have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote.
Register  of Shar eholders; Record Dates; Transfer  of Shar es
We maintain a register of our shareholders in electronic form through the National Securities Depository Limited and the Central
Depository Services (India) Ltd. For the purpose of determining the shares entitled to annual dividends, the register is closed for a specified
period prior to the Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders. The date on which this period begins is the record date. We may close the
register of shareholders to determine which shareholders are entitled to specified shareholder rights. The Companies Act requires us to give at
least seven days’  prior notice to the public before such closure. We may not close the register of shareholders for more than thirty consecutive
days, and in no event for more than 45 days in a year . Trading of our equity shares, however , may continue while the register of shareholders is
closed.
Shares held through depositaries are transferred in the form of book entries or in electronic form in accordance with the regulations
laid down by SEBI. The requirement to hold the equity shares in book entry form will apply to the ADS holders when the equity shares are
withdrawn from the depository facility upon surrender of the ADSs. In order to trade the equity shares in the Indian market, the withdrawing
ADS holder will be required to comply with the procedures described above.
Following the introduction of the Depositories Act, 1996, and the repeal of Section 22A  of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act,
1956, which enabled companies to refuse to register transfers of shares in some circumstances, the equity shares of a public company are
freely transferable, subject only to the provisions of Section 1 11A of the Companies Act. Since we are a public company , the provisions of
Section 1 11A will apply to us. Our Articles of Association currently contain provisions which give our directors discretion to refuse to register
a transfer of shares in some circumstances. Furthermore, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 11A(2) of the Companies Act, our
directors may refuse to register a transfer of shares if they have suf ficient cause to do so. If our directors refuse to register a transfer of shares,
the shareholder wishing to transfer his, her or its shares may file a civil suit or an appeal with the Company Law Board or National Company
Law Tribunal.
Pursuant to Section 1 11A(3), if a transfer of shares contravenes any of the provisions of the Indian Securities and Exchange Board of
India Act, 1992, or the regulations issued thereunder , or the Indian Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985, or any other
Indian laws, the Company Law Board or National Company Law Tribunal may , on application made by the Company , a depositary
incorporated in India, an investor , the Securities and Exchange Board of India or other parties, direct the rectification of the register of records.
Under the Companies Act, unless the shares of a company are held in a dematerialized form, a transfer of shares is ef fected by an instrument
of transfer in the form prescribed by the Companies Act and the rules thereunder together with delivery of the share certificates. Our transfer
agent for our equity shares is Karvy Computershare Pvt. Limited located in Hyderabad, India.
Company Acquisition of Equity Shar es
Under the Companies Act, the Company can reduce its share capital subject to fulfillment of conditions. A company is not permitted
to acquire its own shares for treasury operations.
Disclosur e of Ownership Inter est
Section 187C of the Indian Companies Act requires beneficial owners of shares of Indian companies who are not holders of record to
declare to the company details of the beneficial owner .
Provisions on Changes in Capital
Our authorized capital can be altered by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders in a general meeting. The additional issue of shares
is subject to the preemptive rights of the shareholders and provisions governing the issue of additional shares are discussed in Item 10 of this
Annual Report. In addition, a company may increase its share capital, consolidate its share capital into shares of lar ger face value than its
existing shares or sub-divide its shares by reducing their par value, subject to an ordinary resolution of the shareholders in a general meeting.

Takeover  Code and Listing Agreements
Under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997, or the
Takeover Code, upon the acquisition of more than 5% and every 2% thereafter of the outstanding shares or voting rights of a publicly-listed
Indian company , a purchaser is required to notify the company and the company and the purchaser is required to notify all the stock exchanges
on which the shares of such company are listed. An ADS holder would be subject to these notification requirements.
Upon the acquisition of 25% or more of such shares or voting rights, or a change in control of the company , the purchaser is required
to make an open of fer to the other shareholders, of fering to purchase 26% of all the outstanding shares of the company or such number of
shares that will result in the public shareholding not falling below the minimum public holding requirement, whichever is lower . SEBI has
recently amended the Takeover Code to revise the existing limits and procedures. Since we are a listed company in India, the provisions of the
Takeover Code will apply to us and to the acquisition of ADS having voting rights. The acquisition of ADSs having voting rights, irrespective
of conversion into underlying equity shares, is subject to disclosures, acquisition trigger and the reporting requirements under the Takeover
Code.
A listed company can be delisted under the provisions of the SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003, which govern voluntary
and compulsory delisting of shares of Indian companies from the stock exchanges.
Material Contracts
We are a party to various employment arrangements and indemnification agreements with our directors and executive of ficers. See
“Terms of Employment Arrangements and Indemnification Agreements” under Item 6 of this Annual Report for a further description of the
employment arrangements and indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and executive of ficers.
Curr ency Exchange Contr ols
Foreign investments in India are governed by the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) 1999 and are subject
to the regulations issued by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time. The Foreign Direct Investment Scheme under the Reserve Bank’ s
Automatic Route enables Indian companies, other than those specifically excluded, to issue shares to persons residing outside India without
prior permission from the RBI, subject to certain conditions. General permission has been granted for the transfer of shares and convertible
debentures by a person resident outside India as follows: (i) for transfers of shares or convertible debentures held by a person resident outside
India other than NRI, to any person resident outside India and (ii) NRIs are permitted to transfer shares or convertible debentures of Indian
company to other NRIs. General permission has also been given for transfers between a person resident in India and a person resident outside
India subject to stipulated conditions.
In cases where such conditions are not met, approval of the Central Government and the Reserve Bank of India may be also required.
Banks in India may now allow remittance from India by a person resident in India up to US$200,000, per financial year , for any
permitted current or capital account transaction or a combination of both.
General
Shares of Indian companies represented by ADSs may be approved for issuance to foreign investors by the Government of India
under the Issue of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds and Equity Shares (through Depositary Receipt Mechanism) Scheme, 1993, or the
1993 Regulation, as modified from time to time, promulgated by the Government of India. The 1993 Regulation is distinct from other policies
or facilities, as described below , relating to investments in Indian companies by foreign investors. The issuance of ADSs pursuant to the 1993
Regulation also af fords to holders of the ADSs the benefits of Section 1 15AC of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961 for purposes of the
application of Indian tax law .
A registered broker is permitted to purchase shares of an Indian company on behalf of a person resident outside of India for the
purpose of converting those shares into ADSs or GDSs. However , such conversion is subject to compliance with the provisions of the Issue of
Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds and Ordinary Shares (Through Depositary Receipt Mechanism) Scheme 1993 and the periodic
guidelines issued by the Central Government. Therefore ADSs converted into Indian shares may be converted back into ADSs, subject to
certain limits of sectoral caps.
The Operative Guidelines for the limited two-way fungibility under the “Issue of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds and Ordinary
Shares” (Through Depositary Receipt Mechanism) Scheme 1993 has also been approved by the Government of India.

These guidelines provide that a re-issuance of ADSs or GDSs is permitted to the extent that such ADSs or GDSs, have been redeemed
for underlying shares and sold in the domestic market. The re-issuance must be within the specified limits. The conditions to be satisfied in
this regard are: (i) the shares are purchased on a recognized stock exchange; (ii) the Indian company has issued ADSs or GDSs, (iii) the shares
are purchased with the permission of the custodian of the ADSs or GDSs of the Indian company and are deposited with the custodian; (iv) the
number of shares so purchased shall not exceed the number of ADSs or GDSs converted into underlying shares pursuant to conversion of
ADSs into equity shares under the Depositary Agreement and (v) investor and other intermediaries comply with the provisions of 1993
Scheme and related guidelines issued from time to time.
Transfer  of ADSs and Surr ender  of ADSs
A person resident outside India may transfer the ADSs held in Indian companies to another person resident outside India without any
permission. An ADS holder is permitted to surrender the ADSs held by him in an Indian company and to receive the underlying equity shares
under the terms of the Deposit Agreement. Under Indian regulations, the re-deposit of these equity shares with the depositary to ADSs may not
be permitted.
Sponsor ed ADS
The amendment to the FEMA  regulations permits an issuer in India to sponsor the issue of ADSs through an overseas depositary
against underlying equity shares accepted from holders of its equity shares in India for of fering outside of India. The sponsored issue of ADSs
is possible only if the following conditions are satisfied:
 
 • There have been amendments to the Issue of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds and Ordinary Shares (through Depositary
Receipt Mechanism), Scheme 1993 pertaining to the Eligibility of Issuer , Eligibility of Subscriber , Pricing of the of ferings, and
Voting Rights;
 
 • the ADS of fering is approved by the FIPB;
 
 • the ADS of fering is approved by a special resolution of the shareholders of the issuer in a general meeting;

 • the sales of the existing equity shares are made in compliance with the Foreign Direct Investment Policy in India;
 
 • the number of shares of fered by selling shareholders are subject to limits in proportion to the existing holdings of the selling
shareholders when the of fer is oversubscribed; and
 
 • the of fering expenses do not exceed 7% of the of fering proceeds and are paid by shareholders on a pro-rata basis.
The issuer is also required to furnish a report to the RBI specifying the details of the of fering, including the amount raised through the
offering, the number of ADSs issued, the underlying shares of fered and the percentage of equity in the issuer represented by the ADSs.
Conditions for  issuance of ADSs or  GDSs outside India by Indian Companies
Eligibility of issuer : An Indian company , which is not eligible to raise funds from the Indian Capital Market including a company
which has been restrained from accessing the securities market by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) will not be eligible to
issue ADSs or GDSs apart from Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds.
Eligibility of subscriber : Overseas Corporate Bodies (OCBs) who are not eligible to invest in India through the portfolio route and
entities prohibited to buy , sell or deal in securities by SEBI will not be eligible to subscribe to (i) Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds and
(ii) ADSs or GDSs.
Pricing : The pricing of ADSs or GDSs and Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds should not be less than the average of the weekly
high and low of the closing prices of the related shares quoted on the stock exchange during the two weeks preceding the relevant date.

Foreign Dir ect Investment
Over a period of time, and particularly since 1991, the Government of India has relaxed the restrictions on foreign investment and
most industry sectors do not require prior approval of the FIPB or RBI, if the percentage of equity holding by all foreign investors do not
exceed specified industry specific thresholds. Moreover , the Government of India recently relaxed the thresholds for approval of FIPB for total
foreign equity inflow and such approval will be required only for such inflow of Rs. 12,000 million and above. Purchases by foreign investors
of ADSs are treated as direct foreign investment in the equity issued by Indian companies for such of ferings. Foreign investment up to 100%
of a company’ s share capital is currently permitted in the IT  industry . The Government of India has recently clarified the calculation of foreign
investment in an Indian Company through direct or indirect routes for such investment.
Investment by Non-Resident Indians
A variety of facilities for making investments in shares of Indian companies is available to individuals of Indian nationality or origin
residing outside India. These facilities permit NRIs to make portfolio investments in shares and other securities of Indian companies on a basis
that is not generally available to other foreign investors. A Non-Resident Indian (NRI) or a Person of Indian Origin (PIO) resident outside
India may invest by way of contribution to the capital of a firm or a proprietary concern in India on a non-repatriation basis. These facilities
are dif ferent and distinct from investments by the Foreign Direct Investors described above. Indian companies are now allowed, without prior
Government of India approval, to invest in joint ventures or wholly-owned subsidiaries outside India. The amount invested may not exceed
four times the net worth of the company or its equivalent in a financial year . The RBI no longer recognizes Overseas Corporate Bodies, or
OCBs as an eligible class of investment vehicle under various routes and schemes under the foreign exchange regulations.
NRIs are permitted to make investments through a stock exchange, or Portfolio Investments on favorable tax and other terms under
India’ s Portfolio Investment Scheme. Under the scheme, an NRI can purchase up to 5% of the paid up value of the shares issued by a
company , subject to the condition that the aggregate paid up value of shares purchased by all NRIs does not exceed 10% of the paid up capital
of the company . The 10% ceiling may be exceeded if a special resolution is passed in a general meeting of the shareholders of a company ,
subject to the overall ceiling of Foreign Direct Investment limit.
In terms of Schedule 1 of the Notification No. FEMA  20/2000-RB dated May 3, 2000, a person resident outside India can purchase
equity shares/compulsorily convertible preference shares and compulsorily convertible debentures (equity instruments) issued by an Indian
company under the FDI policy and the Indian company is allowed to receive the amount of consideration in advance towards issue of such
equity instruments, subject to the terms and conditions laid down therein. Further , general permission is available to Indian companies to
refund the amounts received towards purchase of shares under Regulation 5 (1) of Notification No. FEMA  20/2000-RB dated May 3, 2000 , as
amended from time to time. The Reserve Bank of India vide circular No. 20 dated December 14, 2007, decided that with ef fect from
November 29, 2007, the equity instruments should be issued within 180 days of the receipt of the inward remittance. If the equity instruments
are not issued within 180 days from the date of receipt of the inward remittance or date of debit to the NRE/FCNR (B) account, the amount of
consideration so received should be refunded immediately to the non-resident investor by outward remittance through normal banking
channels or by credit to the NRE/FCNR (B) account, as the case may be or the approach the Reserve Bank of India with an action plan for
allotment of equity shares.
It is also clarified that the advances against equity instruments may be received only where the FDI is allowed under the automatic
route.
Investment by For eign Institutional Investors
In September 1992, the Government of India issued guidelines which permitted foreign institutional investors or FIIs, including
institutions such as pension funds, investment trusts, asset management companies, nominee companies and incorporated/institutional
portfolio managers, to invest in all the securities traded on the primary and secondary markets in India. Under the guidelines, FIIs are required
to obtain an initial registration from the SEBI and a general permission from the RBI to engage in transactions regulated under FEMA. FIIs
must also comply with the provisions of the SEBI Foreign Institutional Investors Regulations, 1995.

Ownership Restrictions
The limit of FII investment in a company has been linked to sectoral caps/statutory ceilings as applicable to the concerned industry
subject to obtaining the approval of the shareholders by a special resolution. NRIs in the aggregate may hold no more than 24% of a
company’ s equity shares (subject to obtaining the approval of the shareholders by a special resolution), excluding the equity shares underlying
the ADSs. Furthermore, SEBI regulations provide that no single FII may hold more than 10% of a company’ s total equity shares and no single
NRI may hold more than 5% of a company’ s total equity shares. There is uncertainty under Indian law about the tax regime applicable to FIIs
which hold and trade ADSs. FIIs are ur ged to consult with their Indian legal and tax advisers about the relationship between the FII guidelines
and the ADSs and any equity shares withdrawn upon surrender of ADSs.
Overseas investment – Liberalization
Regulation 6 of the Notification No. FEMA.120/RB-2004 dated July 7, 2004 read together with Circular No. 42 dated May 12, 2005,
and dated September 26, 2007, issued by the Reserve Bank of India provides the terms of which an Indian entity was permitted to invest up to
400% of their net worth in overseas Joint Ventures and/or Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (“JV/WOS”) in any bonafide business activity under
automatic route.
Taxation
The following summary is based on the law and practice of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1961, or Income Tax Act, including the special
tax regime contained in Sections 1 15AC and 1 15ACA  of the Income Tax Act read with the Issue of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds and
Ordinary Shares (through Depositary Receipt Mechanism) Scheme, 1993, as amended on, January 19, 2000, or the Issue of Foreign Currency
Convertible bonds and Ordinary Shares Scheme. The Income Tax Act is amended every year by the Finance Act of the relevant year . Some or
all of the tax consequences of Sections 1 15AC and 1 15ACA  may be amended or changed by future amendments to the Income Tax Act.
We believe this information is materially complete as of the date hereof, however , this summary is not intended to constitute a
complete analysis of the individual tax consequences to non-resident holders or employees under Indian law for the acquisition, ownership and
sale of ADSs and equity shares.
Residence . For purposes of the Income Tax Act, an individual is considered to be a resident of India during any fiscal year if he or she

 • a period or periods amounting to 182 days or more; or
 
 • 60 days or more and, within the four preceding years has been in India for a period or periods amounting to 365 days or more.
The period of 60 days referred to above shall be read as 182 days (i) in case of a citizen of India who leaves India in a fiscal year for
the purposes of employment outside of India or (ii) in case of a citizen of India or a person of Indian origin living abroad who visits India and
within the four preceding years has been in India for a period or periods amounting to 365 days or more.
A company is a resident of India if it is incorporated in India or the control and the management of its af fairs is situated wholly in
India. Companies that are not residents of India would be treated as non-residents for purposes of the Income Tax Act.
Taxation of Distributions.  As per Section 10(34) of the Income Tax Act, dividends paid by Indian Companies on or after April 1, 2003
to their shareholders (whether resident in India or not) are not subject to tax. However , the Company paying the dividend is currently subject
to a dividend distribution tax (DDT) of 15% on the total amount it distributes, declares or pays as a dividend, in addition to the normal
corporate tax. The Finance Act, 2013 has proposed to increase the surchar ge on DDT  for domestic companies from 5% to 10%. The Finance
Act 2006 introduced an additional surchar ge called an “education cess” of 3% on such taxes and surchar ge, based on which the ef fective tax
on dividend distributed is 16.995%. Further with ef fect from June 1, 201 1, the SEZ developers profits will also be included while calculating
the DDT , which was previously exempt from the DDT . Currently the cascading ef fect is avoided only for the immediate domestic subsidiary
company , which is not a subsidiary of another subsidiary . The Finance Act, 2012, with a view to remove the cascading ef fect in a multi-tier
corporate structure, has amended the Act specifying that the holding company is not required to pay DDT  on its dividend distributed (in the
same fiscal year) to the extent the DDT  has already been paid by its subsidiary . The Finance Act, 2013 has amended the Finance Act, 2012 to
specify that the 15% tax paid on dividends received from a foreign subsidiary is available for set-of f against the DDT  payable by a domestic
company .
Any distributions of additional ADSs or equity shares to resident or non- resident holders will not be subject to Indian tax.

Taxation of Capital Gains . The following is a brief summary of capital gains taxation of non-resident holders and resident employees
in respect of the sale of ADSs and equity shares received upon redemption of ADSs. The relevant provisions are contained mainly in sections
45, 47(vii)(a), 1 15AC and 1 15ACA, of the Income Tax Act, in conjunction with the Issue of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds and
Ordinary Shares Scheme.
Gains realized upon the sale of ADSs and shares that have been held for a period of more than thirty-six months and twelve months,
respectively , are considered long-term capital gains. Gains realized upon the sale of ADSs and shares that have been held for a period of thirty
six months or less and twelve months or less, respectively , are considered short term capital gains. Capital gains are taxed as follows:
 
 • Gains from a sale of ADSs outside India, by a non-resident to another non-resident are not taxable in India.
 
 • Long-term capital gains realized by a resident employee from the transfer of the ADSs will be subject to tax at the rate of 10%.
Short-term capital gains on such a transfer will be taxed at graduated rates with a maximum of 30%.
 
 • Long-term capital gains realized by a non-resident upon the sale of equity shares obtained through the redemption of ADSs, or
settlement of such sale being made of f a recognized stock exchange, are subject to tax at a rate of 10%. Short-term capital gains on
such transfer will be taxed at graduated rates with a maximum of 30%.
 
 • Long-term capital gains realized by a non-resident upon the sale of equity shares obtained through the redemption of ADSs, or
settlement of such sale being made on a recognized stock exchange, is exempt from tax and the short-term capital gains on such
sale will be taxed at 15%. An additional tax called “Securities Transaction Tax”, or “STT” (described in detail below) will be levied
at the time of settlement.
 
 • In addition to the above, a surchar ge as set forth below and an additional surchar ge called an “education cess” of 3% is levied as
follows:
 
Category of person  Surcharge %
  Existing   Proposed by Finance Act, 2013
Resident other than company
  Nil   10%, if total income >
Rs. 10 million
Resident company

million and < Rs. 100
million
   
 
     5%, if total income >
Rs. 100 million
The above rates may be reduced by the applicable tax treaty in case of non-residents. The capital gains tax is computed by applying
the appropriate tax rates to the dif ference between the sale price and the purchase price of the equity shares or ADSs. In the case of employees
who receive shares allotted as part of a company’ s stock option plan, the purchase price shall be the fair market value which has been taken
into account for the purpose of computing the perquisite on salaries. In 1992, the government allowed established Indian companies to issue
foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCB). Ef fective April 2008, the conversion of FCCBs into shares or debentures of any company shall
not be treated as a ‘transfer ’ and consequently will not be subject to capital gains tax upon conversion. Further , the cost of acquisition of the
shares received upon conversion of the bond shall be the price at which the corresponding bond was acquired. Prior to this amendment, the
price of the shares received on conversion was arrived by using the “stepped up” basis.
With the enactment of Finance Act (No.2) 2009, the value of shares/securities allotted under any Employees Stock Option Plan is
treated as a perquisite in the hands of employees and will be taxed accordingly ef fective April 1, 2009. The tax rate will vary from employee to
employee with a maximum of 30.90% (subject to the prevailing tax rate slab) on the perquisite value. The perquisite value is calculated as the
difference between the fair market value of the share / security on the date of exercise minus the exercise price.

According to the Issue of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds and Ordinary Shares Scheme, a non-resident holder ’s holding period
for the purposes of determining the applicable Indian capital gains tax rate in respect of equity shares received in exchange for ADSs
commences on the date of notice of the redemption by the depositary to the custodian. However , the Issue of Foreign Currency Convertible
Bonds and Ordinary Shares Scheme does not address this issue in the case of resident employees, and it is therefore unclear as to when the
holding period for the purposes of determining capital gains tax commences for such a resident employee.
The Issue of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds and Ordinary Shares Scheme provides that if the equity shares are sold on a
recognized stock exchange in India against payment in Indian rupees, they will no longer be eligible for the preferential tax treatment.
It is unclear as to whether section 1 15AC and the Issue of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds and Ordinary Shares Scheme are
applicable to a non-resident who acquires equity shares outside India from a non-resident holder of equity shares after receipt of the equity
shares upon redemption of the ADSs.
It is unclear as to whether capital gains derived from the sale of subscription rights or other rights by a non-resident holder not entitled
to an exemption under a tax treaty will be subject to Indian capital gains tax. If such subscription rights or other rights are deemed by the
Indian tax authorities to be situated within India, the gains realized on the sale of such subscription rights or other rights will be subject to
Indian taxation. The capital gains realized on the sale of such subscription rights or other rights, which will generally be in the nature of short
term capital gains, will be subject to tax at variable rates with a maximum rate of 40% in the case of foreign companies and at graduated rate
with a maximum of 30%, in the case of resident employees and non-resident individuals. In addition to this, there will be a surchar ge levied as
set forth on the table below and an additional surchar ge called “education cess” of 3% in addition to the above tax and surchar ge will be
levied.

As per Section 55(2) of the Income Tax Act, the cost of any share (commonly called a “bonus share”) allotted to any shareholder
without any payment and on the basis of such shareholder ’s share holdings, shall be nil. The holding period of bonus shares for the purpose of
determining the nature of capital gains shall commence on the date of allotment of such shares by the company .

Securities T ransaction T ax: The Finance Act, 2004 had introduced certain new provisions with regard to taxes on the sale and
purchase of securities, including equity shares. On and after October 1, 2004, in respect of a sale and purchase of equity shares entered into on
a recognized stock exchange, (i) both the buyer and seller are required to pay each a Securities Transaction Tax, or STT  at the prescribed rates
on the transaction value of the securities, if a transaction is a delivery based transaction (i.e. the transaction involves actual delivery or transfer
of shares); and (ii) the seller of the shares is required to pay a STT  at the prescribed rates on the transaction value of the securities, if the
transaction is a non-delivery based transaction, i.e. a transaction settled without taking delivery of the shares. The Finance Act, 2013 has
proposed to reduce the rate of STT  as follows:
 
Sl No   Nature of taxable securities transactions   Payable by   Exiting rates

4   Sale of unit of an equity oriented fund to the mutual fund   Seller    0.25     0.001   
Withholding T ax on Capital Gains . Any gain realized by a non-resident or resident employee on the sale of equity shares is subject to
Indian capital gains tax, which, in the case of a non-resident is to be withheld at the source by the buyer . However , as per the provisions of
Section 196D(2) of the Income Tax Act, no withholding tax is required to be deducted by way of capital gains arising to Foreign Institutional
Investors as defined in Section 1 15AD of the Income Tax Act on the transfer of securities defined in Section 1 15AD of the Income Tax Act.
Buy-back of Securities . Indian companies are not subject to any tax on the buy-back of their shares. However , the shareholders will be
taxed on any resulting gains. Our company would be required to deduct the tax at source according to the capital gains tax liability of a non-
resident shareholder . The Finance Act 2013 has levied a tax of 20% against the company for consideration paid to shareholders (in excess of
the initial subscription amount) towards buy-back of shares by an unlisted company .
Stamp Duty and T ransfer T ax. Upon issuance of the equity shares underlying our ADSs, companies will be required to pay a stamp
duty of 0.1% per share of the issue price of the underlying equity shares. A transfer of ADSs is not subject to Indian stamp duty . However ,
upon the acquisition of equity shares from the depositary in exchange for ADSs, the non-resident holder will be liable for Indian stamp duty at
the rate of 0.25% of the market value of the ADSs or equity shares exchanged. A sale of equity shares by a non-resident holder will also be
subject to Indian stamp duty at the rate of 0.25% of the market value of the equity shares on the trade date, although customarily such tax is
borne by the transferee. Shares must be traded in dematerialized form. The transfer of shares in dematerialized form is currently not subject to
stamp duty .
Wealth T ax. The holding of the ADSs and the holding of underlying equity shares by resident and non-resident holders will be exempt
from Indian wealth tax. Non-resident holders are advised to consult their own tax advisors regarding this issue.
Gift T ax and Estate Duty . The Indian gift tax was abolished as of October 1998. The Indian Estate Duty was abolished as of
March 1985. On and after September 1, 2004, a sum of money exceeding Rs. 25,000 (approx US$561), received by an individual without
consideration will be subject to tax at graduated rates with a maximum of 30% (excluding applicable surchar ge and education cess), unless the
same was received from a relative as defined in Explanation under Section 56(v), or on the occasion of the marriage of the individual or under
a will or by way of inheritance or in contemplation of death of the payer . The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, 2005 introduced in the
Parliament on May 12, 2005 proposes to levy the above tax in case the sum of money exceeds in aggregate Rs. 50,000 in a fiscal year . The
Finance Act 2009 has inserted a new section 56(vii) with ef fect from October 1, 2009 to tax at a maximum rate of 30%, any sum of money or
any immovable property received by an individual or HUF without consideration exceeding Rs. 50,000 (Stamp duty value in case of
immovable property) during the year . The same is exempt from tax if it is received from any relative, occasion of marriage, under a will or by
way of inheritance, or in contemplation of death of the payer or donor . We cannot assure that these provisions will not be amended further in
future. Non-resident holders are advised to consult their own tax advisors regarding this issue.
Service T ax. Brokerage or commission paid to stock brokers in connection with the sale or purchase of shares is subject to a service
tax of 12% excluding the education cess. The Finance Act, 2012 has increased the rate of service tax from 10% to 12%. The stock broker is
responsible for collecting the service tax from the shareholder and paying it to the relevant authority .

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant with respect to the acquisition,
ownership and disposition of equity shares or ADSs and is for general information only . This summary addresses the U.S. federal income tax
considerations of U.S. holders. For purposes of this discussion, “U.S. holders” are citizens or residents of the United States, or corporations (or
other entities treated as corporations for United States federal income tax purposes) created in or under the laws of the United States or any
political subdivision thereof or therein, estates, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source and
trusts having a valid election to be treated as U.S. persons in ef fect under U.S. Treasury Regulations or for which a U.S. court exercises
primary supervision and a U.S. person has the authority to control all substantial decisions.
This summary is limited to U.S. holders who hold or will hold equity shares or ADSs as capital assets. In addition, this summary is
limited to U.S. holders who are not residents in India for purposes of the Convention between the Government of the United States of America
and the Government of the Republic of India for the avoidance of Double Taxation and the prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to taxes
on income. If a partnership holds the equity shares or ADSs, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner
and upon the activities of the partnership. A partner in a partnership holding equity shares or ADSs should consult its own tax advisor .
This summary does not address any tax considerations arising under the laws of any U.S. state or local or foreign jurisdiction,
potential application of the Medicare contribution tax, or tax considerations under any U.S. non-income tax laws. In addition, this summary
does not address tax considerations applicable to holders that may be subject to special tax rules, such as banks, insurance companies,
regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, financial institutions, dealers in securities or currencies, tax-exempt entities,
persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons that will hold equity shares or ADSs as a position in a “straddle” or as part of a “hedging”
or “conversion” transaction for tax purposes, persons holding ADSs or equity shares through partnerships or other pass-through entities,
persons that have a “functional currency” other than the U.S. dollar or holders of 10% or more, by voting power or value, of the shares of our
company . This summary is based on the tax laws of the United States as in ef fect on the date of this document and on United States Treasury
Regulations in ef fect or , in some cases, proposed, as of the date of this document, as well as judicial and administrative interpretations thereof
available on or before such date and is based in part on the assumption that each obligation in the deposit agreement and any related agreement
will be performed in accordance with its terms. All of the foregoing is subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could
affect the tax consequences described below .
EACH PROSPECTIVE INVEST OR SHOULD CONSUL T ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT  TO THE U.S. FEDERAL,
STATE, LOCAL  AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES OF ACQUIRING, OWNING OR DISPOSING OF EQUITY  SHARES OR ADSs.
Ownership of ADSs . For U.S. federal income tax purposes, holders of ADSs generally will be treated as the owners of equity shares
represented by such ADSs. Accordingly , the conversion of ADSs into equity shares generally will not be subject to United States federal
income tax.
Dividends . Except for equity shares, if any , distributed pro rata to all shareholders of our company , including holders of ADSs, the
gross amount of any distributions of cash or property with respect to equity shares or ADSs will generally be included in income by a U.S.
holder as foreign source dividend income at the time of receipt, which in the case of a U.S. holder of ADSs generally should be the date of
receipt by the depositary , to the extent such distributions are made from the current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under
U.S. federal income tax principles) of our company . Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed
to corporate U.S. holders. To the extent, if any , that the amount of any distribution by our company exceeds our company’ s current and
accumulated earnings and profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, such excess will be treated first as a tax-free return
of the U.S. holder ’s tax basis in the equity shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain.
Subject to certain conditions and limitations, including the passive foreign investment company rules described below , dividends paid
to non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, may be eligible for a reduced rate of taxation if we are deemed to be a “qualified foreign
corporation” for United States federal income tax purposes.
A qualified foreign corporation includes a foreign corporation if (1) its shares (or , according to legislative history , its ADSs) are
readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States, or (2) it is eligible for the benefits under a comprehensive income tax
treaty with the United States. In addition, a corporation is not a qualified foreign corporation if it is a passive foreign investment company (as
discussed below). Our ADSs are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, an established securities market in the United States as identified by
Internal Revenue Service guidance. We may also be eligible for benefits under the comprehensive income tax treaty between India and the
United States.

EACH U.S. HOLDER SHOULD CONSUL T ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE TREA TMENT  OF DIVIDENDS AND
SUCH HOLDER’S ELIGIBILITY  FOR REDUCED RA TE OF TAXA TION UNDER THE LA W IN EFFECT  FOR THE YEAR OF THE
DIVIDEND.
Subject to certain conditions and limitations, Indian dividend withholding tax, if any , imposed upon distributions paid to a U.S. holder
with respect to such holder ’s equity shares or ADSs generally should be eligible for credit against the U.S. holder ’s federal income tax
liability . Alternatively , a U.S. holder may claim a deduction for such amount, but only for a year in which a U.S. holder does not claim a credit
with respect to any foreign income taxes. The overall limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to
specific classes of income. For this purpose, distributions on equity shares or ADSs will be income from sources outside the United States and
will generally be “passive category income” purposes of computing the United States foreign tax credit allowable to a U.S. holder .
If dividends are paid in Indian rupees, the amount of the dividend distribution included in the income of a U.S. holder will be in the
U.S. dollar value of the payments made in Indian rupees, determined at a spot exchange rate between Indian rupees and U.S. dollars applicable
to the date such dividend is included in the income of the U.S. holder , regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.
Generally , gain or loss, if any , resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date the dividend is paid to the date
such payment is converted into U.S. dollars will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss.
Sale or Exchange of Equity Shar es or ADSs . A U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale or exchange of equity
shares or ADSs equal to the dif ference between the amount realized on such sale or exchange and the U.S. holder ’s adjusted tax basis in the
equity shares or ADSs, as the case may be. Subject to the “Passive Foreign Investment Company” discussion below , such gain or loss will be
capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the equity shares or ADSs, as the case may be, were held for more than one
year. Gain or loss, if any , recognized by a U.S. holder generally will be treated as U.S. source passive category income or loss for U.S. foreign
tax credit purposes. Capital gains realized by a U.S. holder upon sale of equity shares (but not ADSs) may be subject to tax in India, including
withholding tax. See taxation – “T axation of Distributions – Taxation of Capital Gains”. Due to limitations on foreign tax credits, however , a
U.S. holder may not be able to utilize any such taxes as a credit against the U.S. holder ’s federal income tax liability .
Backup W ithholding T ax and Information Reporting. Any dividends paid, or proceeds on a sale of, equity shares or ADSs to or by a
U.S. holder may be subject to U.S. information reporting, and backup withholding, currently at a rate of 28%, may apply unless the holder is
an exempt recipient or provides a U.S. taxpayer identification number , certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding and
otherwise complies with any applicable backup withholding requirements. Any amount withheld under the backup withholding rules will be
allowed as a refund or credit against the holder ’s U.S. federal income tax, provided that the required information is furnished to the Internal
Revenue Service.
Passive For eign Investment Company . A non-U.S. corporation will be classified as a passive foreign investment company for U.S.
Federal income tax purposes if either:
 
 • 75% or more of its gross income for the taxable year is passive income; or
 
 • on average for the taxable year by value, or , if it is not a publicly traded corporation and so elects, by adjusted basis, if 50% or
more of its assets produce or are held for the production of passive income.
We do not believe that we satisfy either of the tests for passive foreign investment company status for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2013. However , because this determination is made on an annual basis and depends on a variety of factors (including the value of our ADSs),
no assurance can be given that we were not considered a passive foreign investment company in a prior period, or that we will not be
considered a passive foreign investment company for the current taxable year and/or future taxable years. If we were to be a passive foreign
investment company for any taxable year , U.S. holders would be required to either:
 
 • pay an interest char ge together with tax calculated at an ordinary income rates on “excess distributions,” as the term is defined in
relevant provisions of U.S. tax laws, and on any gain on a sale or other disposition of equity shares;
 
 • if an election is made to be a “qualified electing fund” (as the term is defined in relevant provisions of the U.S. tax laws), include in
their taxable income their pro rata share of undistributed amounts of our income; or
 
 • if the equity shares are “marketable” and a mark-to-market election is made, mark-to-market the equity shares each taxable year
and recognize ordinary gain and, to the extent of prior ordinary gain, ordinary loss for the increase or decrease in market value for
such taxable year .
If we are treated as a passive foreign investment company , we do not plan to provide information necessary for the “qualified electing
fund” election.

Item 1 1. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosur es About Market Risk
(in millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)
General
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a
financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange
rates, equity prices and other market changes that af fect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk
sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and borrowings.
Our exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating activities in foreign currency .
The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of our earnings and equity to losses.
Risk Management Pr ocedur es
We manage market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent control over the entire
process of market risk management. Our corporate treasury department recommends risk management objectives and policies, which are
approved by senior management and Audit Committee. The activities of this department include management of cash resources, implementing
hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies.
Components of Market Risk
Foreign curr ency risk
We operate internationally and a major portion of our business is transacted in several currencies. Consequently , the Company is
exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the United States and elsewhere, and making purchases
from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The exchange rate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables,
cash balances, forecasted cash flows, payables and foreign currency loans and borrowings. A significant portion of our revenue is in U.S.
dollars, Euro and Pound Sterling, while a significant portion of our costs are in Indian rupees. The exchange rate between the rupee and U.S.
dollar , euro and pound sterling has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the
rupee against these currencies can adversely af fect our results of operations.
We evaluate our exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to
mitigate such exposure. We follow established risk management policies, including the use of derivatives like foreign exchange

We have designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedge to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure of forecasted highly
probable cash flows. We have also designated a combination of foreign currency borrowings and related cross-currency swaps and other
foreign currency derivative instruments as hedge of its net investment in foreign operations.
As of March 31, 2013, a Rs. 1 increase/decrease in the spot exchange rate of Indian rupee with U.S. dollar would result in
approximately Rs. 1,638 decrease/increase in the fair value of our foreign currency dollar denominated derivative instruments.
As of March 31, 2013, a 1% change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the yen would result in approximately Rs. 182
increase/decrease in the fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps.
Inter est rate risk
Interest rate risk primarily arises from floating rate borrowing, including various revolving and other lines of credit. Our investments
are primarily in short-term investments, which do not expose us to significant interest rate risk. Our net exposure to interest rate risk relating to
borrowings, by balancing the proportion of fixed rate borrowing and floating rate borrowing in its total borrowing portfolio. To manage this
portfolio mix, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements, which allows us to exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount
and agreed upon fixed and floating interest rates. As of March 31, 2013, substantially all of our borrowings was subject to floating interest
rates, which reset at short intervals. If interest rates were to increase by 100 bps from March 31, 2013, additional annual interest expense on
our floating rate borrowing would amount to approximately Rs. 496.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this, we
periodically assess the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial condition, current economic trends, analysis of
historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly . No single customer accounted for more than
10% of the accounts receivable as of March 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively and revenues for the year ended March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013,
respectively . There is no significant concentration of credit risk.
Counterparty risk
Counterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market contracts and
credit risk on cash and time deposits. Issuer risk is minimized by only buying securities which are at least AA rated. Settlement and credit risk
is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions with counterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit
ratings. Exposure to these risks are closely monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters. There are limits on credit exposure to
any financial institution. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis including financial statements and capital
adequacy ratio reviews. In addition, net settlement agreements are contracted with significant counterparties.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that we will not be able to settle or meet our obligations on time or at a reasonable price. Our
corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies
related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Company’ s net liquidity position through rolling forecasts
on the basis of expected cash flows. As of March 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents are held with major banks and financial institutions.

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL  REPOR T ON INTERNAL  CONTROL  OVER FINANCIAL  REPOR TING
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules
13a-15 (f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
the International Financial Reporting Standards and their interpretations (“IFRS”), as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board
(“IASB”).
The Company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
 
 (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of our assets;
 
 (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with IFRS, as issued by the IASB and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of our management and directors; and
 
 (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our
assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of ef fectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Of ficer and Chief Financial Of ficer, assessed the ef fectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013. In conducting this assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management
based its evaluation on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Or ganizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of March 31, 2013.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG India, has audited the consolidated financial statements in this Form 20-F ,
and as part of their audit, has issued its report, which is included in this Form 20-F , on the ef fectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2013.

REPOR T OF INDEPENDENT  REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Equity holders
Wipro Limited:
We have audited Wipro Limited’ s (“the Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013, based on criteria
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Or ganizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). The Company’ s management is responsible for maintaining ef fective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the ef fectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’ s Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether ef fective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating ef fectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of ef fectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, ef fective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,
2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Or ganizations of the
Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated statements of financial position of the Company and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity , and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31,
2013, and our report dated 12 June 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Item 16 E. Pur chase of Equity Securities by the Issuer  and Affiliated Pur chasers

Item 16 F . Changes in Registrant’ s Certifying Accountant
None.
Item 16 G. Corporate Governance
Because our securities are listed on a national securities exchange, we are required to provide a concise summary of any significant
ways in which our corporate governance practices dif fer from those followed by domestic companies under the listing standards of that
exchange. Being a foreign private issuer , we are permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the provisions of Section 303A  of the
NYSE Listed Company Manual, except that we are required to comply with the requirements of Sections 303A.06, 303A.1 1 and 303A.12(b)
and (c) thereof. With regard to Section 303A.1 1, although the Company’ s required home country standards on corporate governance may
differ from the NYSE listing standards, the Company’ s actual corporate governance policies and practices are generally in compliance with
the NYSE listing standards applicable to domestic companies. Some of the key dif ferences between the requirements in India and those as per
NYSE Listing requirements are as follows:
 
 • Listing Agreement with Indian stock exchanges require 50% of the Board of Directors to be independent directors in the case of
executive Chairman of the Board (it is 33.33% in other cases) while NYSE listing requirements specify that a majority of the
Board to consist of independent directors.
 
 • Listing Agreement with Indian stock exchanges requires that a majority of the members of the Audit Committee be independent
directors while the NYSE Listing specifies that all the members of the Audit Committee must be independent directors.

 • The requirement for a Nomination Committee and Compensation Committee are not compulsory as per Listing Agreements with
Indian stock exchanges. The Listing Agreements with the Indian stock exchanges do not require independent compensation
committees. These are mandatory requirements as per NYSE Listing requirements. A Shareholders Grievance committee is
mandatory under Listing Agreements with stock exchanges and is not a requirement under NYSE Listing requirements.
 
 • Criteria for determining directors to be independent also dif fer between the two countries Listing requirements.
The other key practices followed in the home country as per home country laws are disclosed elsewhere in this report.

REPOR T OF INDEPENDENT  REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Equity holders
Wipro Limited:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Wipro Limited and subsidiaries (“the Company”)
as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity , and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2013. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’ s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly , in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended March 31, 2013, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by International Accounting Standards
Board.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Wipro
Limited’ s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Or ganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated 12 June 2013
expressed an unqualified opinion on the ef fectiveness of the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting.

(iv) Convenience translation (unaudited)
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared and reported in Indian rupees, the national currency of India.
Solely for the convenience of the readers, the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2013, have been
translated into United States dollars at the certified foreign exchange rate of US$1 = Rs. 54.52, as published by Federal Reserve Board of
Governors on March 29, 2013. No representation is made that the Indian rupee amounts have been, could have been or could be converted into
United States dollars at such a rate or any other rate.
 
(v) Use of estimates and judgment
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that af fect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and
expenses. Actual results may dif fer from those estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the
period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods af fected. In particular , information about significant areas of estimation,
uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant ef fect on the amounts recognized in the
consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes:
 
 a) Revenue r ecognition : The Company uses the percentage of completion method using the input (cost expended) method to
measure progress towards completion in respect of fixed price contracts. Percentage of completion method accounting relies on
estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs. This method is followed when reasonably dependable estimates of the
revenues and costs applicable to various elements of the contract can be made. Key factors that are reviewed in estimating the
future costs to complete include estimates of future labor costs and productivity ef ficiencies. Because the financial reporting of
these contracts depends on estimates that are assessed continually during the term of these contracts, recognized revenue and profit
are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. When estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred, the loss is
provided for in the period in which the loss becomes probable. To date, the Company has not incurred a material loss on any fixed-
price and fixed-timeframe contract.
 
 b) Goodwill : Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying value. The recoverable amount of cash generating units is
determined based on higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell. The calculation involves use of significant estimates and
assumptions which includes revenue growth rates and operating mar gins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-
adjusted discount rate, future economic and market conditions.
 
 c) Income taxes : The major tax jurisdictions for the Company are India and the United States of America. Significant judgments are
involved in determining the provision for income taxes including judgment on whether tax positions are probable of being
sustained in tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve complex issues, which can only be resolved over extended time periods.
Though the Company considers all these issues in estimating income taxes, there could be an unfavorable resolution of such issues.
 
 d) Deferr ed taxes : Deferred tax is recorded on temporary dif ferences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying
amounts, at the rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The ultimate realization of deferred tax
assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary dif ferences and tax
loss carry-forwards become deductible. The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected
future taxable income in making this assessment. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however ,
could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced.
 
 e) Business combination : In accounting for business combinations, judgment is required in identifying whether an identifiable
intangible asset is to be recorded separately from goodwill. Additionally , estimating the acquisition date fair value of the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves management judgment. These measurements are based on information
available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management.
Changes in these judgments, estimates, and assumptions can materially af fect the results of operations.

 f) Other  estimates : The preparation of financial statements involves estimates and assumptions that af fect the reported amount of
assets, liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and
expenses for the reporting period. Specifically , the Company estimates the uncollectability of accounts receivable by analyzing
historical payment patterns, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends. If the financial
condition of a customer deteriorates, additional allowances may be required. Similarly , the Company provides for inventory
obsolescence, excess inventory and inventories with carrying values in excess of net realizable value based on assessment of the
future demand, market conditions and specific inventory management initiatives. If market conditions and actual demands are less
favorable than the Company’ s estimates, additional inventory provisions may be required. In all cases inventory is carried at the
lower of historical cost and net realizable value. The stock compensation expense is determined based on the Company’ s estimate
of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
 
3. Significant accounting policies
 
(i) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Parent Company and entities controlled by the Parent
Company (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity
so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that currently are exercisable are taken into account.
All intra-company balances, transactions, income and expenses including unrealized income or expenses are eliminated in full on
consolidation.
Equity accounted investees
Equity accounted investees are entities in respect of which the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the financial
and operating policies. Generally , a company has a significant influence if it holds between 20 and 50 percent of the voting power of another
entity . Investments in such entities are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are initially recognized at cost.
Non-contr olling inter est
Non-controlling interests in the net assets (excluding goodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the
Company’ s equity . The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling
interest’ s proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’ s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an
acquisition to acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interest is the amount of those interest at
initial recognition plus the non-controlling interest’ s share of subsequent changes in equity . Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-
controlling interests even if it results in the non-controlling interest have a deficit balance.
 
(ii) Functional and pr esentation curr ency
Items included in the consolidated financial statements of each of the Company’ s subsidiaries and equity accounted investees are
measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which these entities operate (i.e. the “functional currency”). These
consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, the national currency of India, which is the functional currency of Wipro
Limited and its domestic subsidiaries and equity accounted investees.
 
(iii) Foreign curr ency transactions and translation
 
 a) Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currency are translated into the respective functional currencies using the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the
translation at the exchange rates prevailing at reporting date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are recognized in the statement of income and reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within results of operating
activities. Gains/losses relating to translation or settlement of borrowings denominated in foreign currency are reported within
finance expense except foreign exchange gains/losses on short-term borrowings, which are considered as a natural economic hedge
for the foreign currency monetary assets are classified and reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within results from
operating activities. Non monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost are
translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction.

 b) Foreign operations
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company’ s foreign operations
that have local functional currency are translated into Indian rupees using exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Income
and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange dif ferences arising, if any , are recognized
in other comprehensive income and held in foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR), a component of equity . When a foreign
operation is disposed of f, the relevant amount recognized in FCTR is transferred to the statement of income as part of the profit or
loss on disposal. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date.
 
 c) Others
Foreign currency dif ferences arising on the translation or settlement of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net
investment in a foreign operation are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the FCTR to the
extent the hedge is ef fective. To the extent the hedge is inef fective, such dif ference are recognized in statement of income. When
the hedged part of a net investment is disposed of f, the relevant amount recognized in FCTR is transferred to the statement of
income as part of the profit or loss on disposal. Foreign currency dif ferences arising from translation of intercompany receivables
or payables relating to foreign operations, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are
considered to form part of net investment in foreign operation and are recognized in FCTR.
 
(iv) Financial Instruments
 
 a) Non-derivative financial instruments
Non derivative financial instruments consist of:
 
 • financial assets, which include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled revenues, finance lease receivables,
employee and other advances, investments in equity and debt securities and eligible current and non-current assets;
 
 • financial liabilities, which include long and short-term loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, trade payable, eligible
current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
Non derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value including any directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial assets are derecognized when substantial risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have been transferred. In
cases where substantial risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are neither transferred nor retained, financial assets
are derecognized only when the Company has not retained control over the financial asset.
Subsequent to initial recognition, non derivative financial instruments are measured as described below:
 
 A. Cash and cash equivalents
The Company’ s cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and in banks and demand deposits with banks, which can
be withdrawn at anytime, without prior notice or penalty on the principal.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, in banks and demand deposits
with banks, net of outstanding bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and are considered part of the Company’ s cash
management system.
 
 B. Available-for -sale financial assets
The Company has classified investments in liquid mutual funds, equity securities, other than equity accounted investees and
certain debt securities (primarily certificate of deposits with banks) as available-for -sale financial assets. These investments are
measured at fair value and changes therein are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented within equity . The
impairment losses, if any , are reclassified from equity into statement of income. When an available for sale financial asset is
derecognized, the related cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to statement of income.

 C. Loans and r eceivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market. They are presented as current assets, except for those maturing later than 12 months after the reporting date which
are presented as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs and
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the ef fective interest method, less any impairment losses. Loans and receivables
comprise trade receivables, unbilled revenues, cash and cash equivalents and other assets.
 
 D. Trade and other  payables
Trade and other payables are initially recognized at fair value, and subsequently carried at amortized cost using the
effective interest method. For these financial instruments, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of
these instruments.
 
 b) Derivative financial instruments
The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations on foreign currency assets, liabilities, net investment in foreign
operations and forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currency .
The Company limits the ef fect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by following established risk management policies
including the use of derivatives. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments where the counterparty is a bank.
Derivatives are recognized and measured at fair value. Attributable transaction cost are recognized in statement of income
as cost.
 
 A. Cash flow hedges
Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in other
comprehensive income and held in cash flow hedging reserve, a component of equity to the extent that the hedge is ef fective. To
the extent that the hedge is inef fective, changes in fair value are recognized in the statement of income and reported within foreign
exchange gains/(losses), net within results from operating activities. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for
hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively . The cumulative
gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the statement of income upon the occurrence
of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur , such cumulative balance is
immediately recognized in the statement of income.
 
 B. Hedges of net investment in for eign operations
The Company designates derivative financial instruments as hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The Company
has also designated a combination of foreign currency denominated borrowings and related cross-currency swaps as a hedge of net
investment in foreign operations. Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instruments and gains/losses on translation or
settlement of foreign currency denominated borrowings designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign operations are
recognized in other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the FCTR to the extent that the hedge is ef fective. To the
extent that the hedge is inef fective, changes in fair value are recognized in the statement of income and reported within foreign
exchange gains/(losses), net within results from operating activities.
 
 C. Others
Changes in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges or hedges of net
investment in foreign operations are recognized in the statement of income and reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net
within results from operating activities.
Changes in fair value and gains/(losses) on settlement of foreign currency derivative instruments relating to borrowings,
which have not been designated as hedges are recorded in finance expense.
 
(v) Equity and shar e capital
 
 a) Shar e capital and shar e premium
The Company has only one class of equity shares. The authorized share capital of the Company is 2,650,000,000 equity
shares, par value Rs. 2 per share. Par value of the equity shares is recorded as share capital and the amount received in excess of
par value is classified as share premium.

employees. The amounts recorded in share based payment reserve are transferred to share premium upon exercise of stock options
by employees.
 
 e) Cash flow hedging r eserve
Changes in fair value of derivative hedging instruments designated and ef fective as a cash flow hedge are recognized in
other comprehensive income (net of taxes), and presented within equity in the cash flow hedging reserve.
 
 f) Foreign curr ency translation r eserve
The exchange dif ference arising from the translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, dif ferences arising
from translation of long-term intercompany receivables or payables relating to foreign operations, changes in fair value of the
derivative hedging instruments and gains/losses on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated borrowings
designated as hedge of net investment in foreign operations are recognized in other comprehensive income, and presented within
equity in the FCTR.
 
 g) Other  reserve
Changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets is recognized in other comprehensive income (net of taxes),
and presented within equity in other reserve.
 
 h) Dividend
A final dividend, including tax thereon, on common stock is recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the
shareholders. An interim dividend, including tax thereon, is recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the board of
directors.
 
(vi) Property , plant and equipment
 
 a) Recognition and measur ement
Property , plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any . Cost
includes expenditures directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction or
production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost.

 b) Depr eciation
The Company depreciates property , plant and equipment over the estimated useful life on a straight-line basis from the date
the assets are available for use. Assets acquired under finance lease and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of
estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease term. Freehold land is not depreciated. The estimated useful life of assets are
reviewed and where appropriate are adjusted, annually . The estimated useful lives of assets for the current and comparative period
are as follows:
 
Category   Useful life
Buildings  30 to 60 years
Plant and machinery   2 to 21 years
Computer equipment and software   2 to 6 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment   3 to 10 years
Vehicles   4 years
When parts of an item of property , plant and equipment have dif ferent useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items
(major components) of property , plant and equipment. Subsequent expenditure relating to property , plant and equipment is
capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Company and the cost of
the item can be measured reliably .
Deposits and advances paid towards the acquisition of property , plant and equipment outstanding as of each reporting date
and the cost of property , plant and equipment not available for use before such date are disclosed under capital work-in-progress.
 
(vii) Business combination, Goodwill and Intangible assets
 
 a) Business combination
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase (acquisition) method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair
value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair value at the date of an acquisition.
Transaction costs incurred in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
The cost of an acquisition also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Any subsequent changes to the fair value of
contingent consideration classified as liabilities are recognized in the consolidated statement of income.
 
 b) Goodwill
The excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Company’ s share in the fair value of the acquiree’ s identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognized as goodwill. If the excess is negative, a bar gain purchase gain is recognized
immediately in the statement of income.
 
 c) Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost of an acquisition. Intangible assets acquired in a business
combination are measured at fair value as at the date of an acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at
cost less any accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any .
The amortization of an intangible asset with a finite useful life reflects the manner in which the economic benefit is
expected to be generated and consumed. Intangible assets with indefinite lives comprising of brands are not amortized, but instead
tested for impairment at least annually and written down to the recoverable amount as required.
The estimated useful life of amortizable intangibles are reviewed and where appropriate are adjusted, annually . The
estimated useful lives of the amortizable intangible assets for the current and comparative periods are as follows:
 
Category   Useful life
Customer -related intangibles   2 to 1 1 years
Marketing related intangibles   20 to 30 years

(viii) Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the
inception date. The arrangement is assessed for whether fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or
assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.
 
 a) Arrangements wher e the Company is the lessee
Leases of property , plant and equipment, where the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present
value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance char ge and the outstanding liability .
The finance char ge is allocated to periods during the lease term at a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of
the liability .
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognized in the statement of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
 
 b) Arrangements wher e the Company is the lessor
In certain arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products given under finance leases. The
Company records gross finance receivables, unearned income and the estimated residual value of the leased equipment on
consummation of such leases. Unearned income represents the excess of the gross finance lease receivable plus the estimated
residual value over the sales price of the equipment. The Company recognizes unearned income as financing revenue over the lease
term using the ef fective interest method.
 
(ix) Inventories
Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value, including necessary provision for obsolescence. Cost is
determined using the weighted average method.
 
(x) Impairment
 
 a) Financial assets
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of
financial assets is impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the amount of impairment loss.
 
 A. Loans and r eceivables
Impairment losses on trade and other receivables are recognized using separate allowance accounts. Refer Note 2 (iv) for
further information regarding the determination of impairment.
 
 B. Available for  sale financial asset
When the fair value of available-for -sale financial assets declines below acquisition cost and there is objective evidence
that the asset is impaired, the cumulative gain/loss that has been recognized in other comprehensive income, a component of equity
in other reserve is transferred to the statement of income. An impairment loss may be reversed in subsequent periods, if the
indicators for the impairment no longer exist. Such reversals are recognized in other comprehensive income.
 
11810/14/23, 12:14 PM FORM 20-F
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1123799/000119312513256124/d548270d20f.htm 121/167Table of Contents
 b) Non financial assets
The Company assesses long-lived assets, such as property , plant, equipment and acquired intangible assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be
recoverable. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset or group of assets. The
recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell (FVLCTS) and its value-in-use
(VIU). If the recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is
less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment
loss and is recognized in the statement of income. If at the reporting date there is an indication that a previously assessed
impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the impairment losses previously recognized are
reversed such that the asset is recognized at its recoverable amount but not exceeding written down value which would have been
reported if the impairment losses had not been recognized initially .
Intangible assets with indefinite lives comprising of brands are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least
annually at the same time and written down to the recoverable amount as required.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the same time and when events occur or changes in circumstances
indicate that the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test is
performed at the level of cash-generating unit or groups of cash-generating units which represent the lowest level at which
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. An impairment in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
 
(xi) Employee Benefit
 
 a) Post-employment and pension plans
The Group participates in various employee benefit plans. Pensions and other post-employment benefits are classified as
either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. Under a defined contribution plan, the Company’ s only obligation is to
pay a fixed amount with no obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold suf ficient assets to pay all employee
benefits. The related actuarial and investment risks fall on the employee. The expenditure for defined contribution plans is
recognized as an expense during the period when the employee provides service. Under a defined benefit plan, it is the Company’ s
obligation to provide agreed benefits to the employees. The related actuarial and investment risks fall on the Company . The present
value of the defined benefit obligations is calculated using the projected unit credit method.
The company has the following employee benefit plans:
 
 A. Provident fund
Employees receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined benefit plan. The employer and employees each
make periodic contributions to the plan. A portion of the contribution is made to the approved provident fund trust managed by the
Company; while the remainder of the contribution is made to the government administered pension fund. The Company is
generally liable for any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government specified minimum rates of return. The Company’ s
obligation in respect of provident fund, which is a defined benefit plan, is provided for based on actuarial valuation using the
projected unit credit method. The Company recognizes actuarial gains and losses immediately in the statement of income.
 
 B. Superannuation
Superannuation plan, a defined contribution scheme is administered by Life Insurance Corporation of India and ICICI
Prudential Insurance Company Limited. The Company makes annual contributions based on a specified percentage of each eligible
employee’ s salary .
 
 C. Gratuity
In accordance with the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, the Company provides for a lump sum payment to eligible
employees, at retirement or termination of employment based on the last drawn salary and years of employment with the Company .
The gratuity fund is managed by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), HDFC Standard Life, TATA AIG and Birla Sun-
life. The Company’ s obligation in respect of the gratuity plan, which is a defined benefit plan, is provided for based on actuarial
valuation using the projected unit credit method. The Company recognizes actuarial gains and losses immediately in the statement
of income.

 b) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognized as an expense when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic
possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide
termination benefit as a result of an of fer made to encourage voluntary redundancy .
 
 c) Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recorded as expense as the related
service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing
plans, if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the
employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably .
 
 d) Compensated absences
The employees of the Company are entitled to compensated absences. The employees can carry forward a portion of the
unutilized accumulating compensated absences and utilize it in future periods or receive cash at retirement or termination of
employment. The Company records an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which the employee renders the
services that increases this entitlement. The Company measures the expected cost of compensated absences as the additional
amount that the Company expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of the reporting
period. The Company recognizes accumulated compensated absences based on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit
method. Non-accumulating compensated absences are recognized in the period in which the absences occur . The Company
recognizes actuarial gains and losses immediately in the statement of income.
 
(xii) Shar e based payment transaction
Employees of the Company receive remuneration in the form of equity settled instruments, for rendering services over a defined
vesting period. Equity instruments granted are measured by reference to the fair value of the instrument at the date of grant. In cases, where
equity instruments are granted at a nominal exercise price, the intrinsic value on the date of grant approximates the fair value. The expense is
recognized in the statement of income with a corresponding increase to the share based payment reserve, a component of equity .
The equity instruments generally vest in a graded manner over the vesting period. The fair value determined at the grant date is
expensed over the vesting period of the respective tranches of such grants (accelerated amortization). The stock compensation expense is
determined based on the Company’ s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
 
(xiii) Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation.
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of
the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party , the
receivable is recognized as an asset, if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be
measured reliably .
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than
the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract. Provisions for onerous contracts are measured at the present value
of lower of the expected net cost of fulfilling the contract and the expected cost of terminating the contract.
 
(xiv) Revenue
The Company derives revenue primarily from software development and related services, BPO services, sale of IT  and other
products.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1123799/000119312513256124/d548270d20f.htm 123/167Table of Contents
 a) Services
The Company recognizes revenue when the significant terms of the arrangement are enforceable, services have been
delivered and the collectability is reasonably assured. The method for recognizing revenues and costs depends on the nature of the
services rendered:
 
 A. Time and materials contracts
Revenues and costs relating to time and materials contracts are recognized as the related services are rendered.
 
 B. Fixed-price contracts
Revenues from fixed-price contracts, including systems development and integration contracts are recognized using the
“percentage-of-completion” method. Percentage of completion is determined based on project costs incurred to date as a
percentage of total estimated project costs required to complete the project. The cost expended (or input) method has been used to
measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity . If the Company does not
have a suf ficient basis to measure the progress of completion or to estimate the total contract revenues and costs, revenue is
recognized only to the extent of contract cost incurred for which recoverability is probable. When total cost estimates exceed
revenues in an arrangement, the estimated losses are recognized in the statement of income in the period in which such losses
become probable based on the current contract estimates.
‘Unbilled revenues’  represent cost and earnings in excess of billings as at the end of the reporting period. ‘Unearned
revenues’  represent billing in excess of revenue recognized. Advance payments received from customers for which no services
have been rendered are presented as ‘Advance from customers’.
 
 C. Maintenance contract
Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the period of the contract using the percentage of
completion method. When services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period of time,
revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the specified period unless some other method better represents the stage of
completion.
In certain projects, a fixed quantum of service or output units is agreed at a fixed price for a fixed term. In such contracts,
revenue is recognized with respect to the actual output achieved till date as a percentage of total contractual output. Any residual
service unutilized by the customer is recognized as revenue on completion of the term.
 
 b) Products
Revenue from products are recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer ,
continuing managerial involvement usually associated with ownership and ef fective control have ceased, the amount of revenue
can be measured reliably , it is probable that economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company and the
costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably .
 
 c) Multiple element arrangements
Revenue from contracts with multiple-element arrangements are recognized using the guidance in IAS 18, Revenue. The
Company allocates the arrangement consideration to separately identifiable components based on their relative fair values or on the
residual method. Fair values are determined based on sale prices for the components when it is regularly sold separately , third-
party prices for similar components or cost plus, an appropriate business-specific profit mar gin related to the relevant component.
 
 d) Others
The Company accounts for volume discounts and pricing incentives to customers by reducing the amount of revenue
recognized at the time of sale.
Revenues are shown net of sales tax, value added tax, service tax and applicable discounts and allowances. Revenue
includes excise duty .
The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties at the time when the revenue is recognized. The accruals are based
on the Company’ s historical experience of material usage and service delivery costs.

or settlement of foreign currency borrowings and changes in fair value and gains / (losses) on settlement of related derivative instruments
except foreign exchange gains/(losses), net on short-term borrowings which are considered as a natural economic hedge for the foreign
currency monetary assets which are classified as foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within results from operating activities. Borrowing costs
that are not directly attributable to a qualifying asset are recognized in the statement of income using the ef fective interest method.
 
(xvi) Finance and other  income
Finance and other income comprises interest income on deposits, dividend income and gains / (losses) on disposal of available-for -
sale financial assets. Interest income is recognized using the ef fective interest method. Dividend income is recognized when the right to
receive payment is established.
 
(xvii) Income tax
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognized in the statement of income except to the extent
it relates to a business combination, or items directly recognized in equity or in other comprehensive income.
 
 a) Curr ent income tax
Current income tax for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to
the taxation authorities based on the taxable income for the period. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the current tax
amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and applicable for the period. The Company of fsets
current tax assets and current tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set of f the recognized amounts and where it
intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and liability simultaneously .
 
 b) Deferr ed income tax
Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for deductible and taxable temporary dif ferences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying
amount in financial statements, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and af fects neither accounting nor taxable profits or loss at the time of
the transaction.
Deferred income tax asset are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which
the deductible temporary dif ferences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary dif ferences except in respect of taxable temporary
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and foreign branches where the timing of the reversal of the
temporary dif ference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary dif ference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that suf ficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the
asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the
reporting date.
The Company of fsets deferred income tax assets and liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to of fset current tax
assets against current tax liabilities, and they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity ,
or on dif ferent taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax
assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously .

(xviii) Earnings per  shar e
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period adjusted
for treasury shares held. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of equity and dilutive equivalent
shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method for options and warrants, except where the results would be
anti-dilutive.
 
(xix) Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Company’ s business that represents a separate line of business that has been
disposed of f or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification as a discontinued operation
occurs upon the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
A demer ger that is a business under common control is outside the scope of IFRS 3, Business Combination and IFRIC 17, Non-
Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and can be accounted using either carrying values or fair values. The
Company accounts for such demer gers at carrying value.
New Accounting standards adopted by the Company:
The Company adopted an amendment to IFRS 7 “Disclosur es – T ransfers of financial assets”  (“IFRS 7”) ef fective April 1, 2012. The
purpose of the amendment is to enhance the existing disclosures in IFRS 7 when an asset is transferred but is not derecognized and introduce
new disclosures for assets that are derecognized but the entity continues to have a continuing exposure to the asset after the sale. Adoption of
amendment to IFRS 7 did not have a material ef fect on these consolidated financial statements.
New Accounting standards not yet adopted by the Company:
In December , 201 1, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 7  “Disclosur es – offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities” . The
amended standard requires additional disclosures where financial assets and financial liabilities are of fset in the statement of financial position.
These disclosures would provide users with information that is useful in (a) evaluating the ef fect or potential ef fect of netting arrangements on
an entity’ s financial position and (b) analyzing and comparing financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRSs and U.S. GAAP . The
amendment is ef fective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Earlier application is permitted. The Company
has evaluated the requirements of IFRS 7 and these requirements are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements.
In November 2009, the IASB issued the chapter of IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments r elating to the classification and measur ement of
financial assets”.  The new standard represents the first phase of a three-phase project to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement (IAS 39) with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9). IFRS 9 uses a single approach to determine whether a financial asset
is measured at amortized cost or fair value, replacing the many dif ferent rules in IAS 39. The approach in IFRS 9 is based on how an entity
manages its financial assets (its business model) and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. In October 2010, the
IASB added the requirement relating to classification and measurement of financial liabilities to IFRS 9. Under the amendment, an entity
measuring its financial liability at fair value, can present the amount of fair value change in the liability attributable to change in the liabilities
credit risk in other comprehensive income. Further the IASB also decided to carry-forward unchanged from IAS 39 requirements relating to
de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 is ef fective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2015. Earlier
application is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact these amendments will have on the Company’ s consolidated financial
statements.
In May 201 1, the IASB issued IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” . The new standard establishes principles for the
presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity controls one or more other entities. IFRS 10 replaces the
consolidation requirements in SIC-12 “Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities”  and IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial
Statements” . IFRS 10 builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should
be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company . The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the
determination of control where this is dif ficult to assess. IFRS 10 is ef fective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Earlier
application is permitted. The Company has evaluated the requirements of IFRS 10 and these requirements are not expected to have a material
impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In May 201 1, the IASB issued IFRS 13 “Fair V alue Measur ement” . The new standard defines fair value, sets out in a single IFRS a
framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. IFRS 13 applies when other IFRSs require or
permit fair value measurements. It does not introduce any new requirements to measure an asset or a liability at fair value or change what is
measured at fair value in IFRSs or address how to present changes in fair value. IFRS 13 is ef fective for fiscal years beginning on or after
January 1, 2013. Early application is permitted. The Company has evaluated the requirements of IFRS 13 and these requirements are not
expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In June 201 1, the IASB issued Amendment to IAS 1 “Pr esentation of Financial Statements”  that will improve and align the
presentation of items of other comprehensive income (OCI) in financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The amendments require companies preparing financial statements in accordance with IFRSs to group together
items within OCI that may be reclassified to the profit or loss section of the income statement. The amendments will also reaf firm existing
requirements that items in OCI and profit or loss should be presented as either a single statement or two consecutive statements. This
amendment is ef fective for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2012. Earlier adoption is permitted. The Company has evaluated the
requirements of IAS 1 and these requirements are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In June 201 1, the IASB issued IAS 19 (Amended) “Employee Benefits” . The new standard has eliminated an option to defer the
recognition of gains and losses through re-measurements and requires such gain or loss to be recognized through other comprehensive income
in the year of occurrence to reduce volatility . The amended standard requires immediate recognition of ef fects of any plan amendments.
Further it also requires return on assets in profit or loss to be restricted to government bond yields or corporate bond yields, considered for
valuation of Projected Benefit Obligation, irrespective of actual portfolio allocations. The actual return from the portfolio in excess of or less
than such yields is recognized through Other Comprehensive Income. The amendment is ef fective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning on
or after January 1, 2013. Earlier adoption is permitted. The Company has evaluated the requirements of IAS 19 (Amended) and these
requirements are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In December , 201 1, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 32  “Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities” . The purpose of
the amendment is to clarify some of the requirements for of fsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on the statements of financial
position. This includes clarifying the meaning of “currently has a legally enforceable right to set-of f” and also the application of the IAS 32
offsetting criteria to settlement systems (such as central clearing house systems) which apply gross settlement mechanisms that are not
simultaneous. The amendment is ef fective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. Earlier application is
permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact these amendments will have on the Company’ s consolidated financial statements.
In May 2012, the IASB issued IFRS 12 “ Disclosur e of Inter ests in Other Entities” . This standard provides comprehensive disclosure
requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose. The objective of the standard
is to enable the entities to disclose the significant judgement and assumptions it has made in determining:
 
 i) the nature of its interest in another entity or arrangement, i.e control, joint control or significant influence.
 
 ii) The type of joint arrangement when the joint arrangement is structured through separate vehicle.
IFRS 12 is ef fective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Early application is permitted. The Company has evaluated
the requirements of IFRS 12 and these requirements are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
 
4. Demerger  of diversified business and discontinued operations
During the year , the Company had initiated and completed the Demer ger of the Diversified Business. The scheme of arrangement
(“Scheme”) involved the transfer of the Diversified Business to Wipro Enterprises Limited (“Resulting Company”), a company incorporated
under the laws of India. The Resulting Company , at the option of the shareholder of the Company , issued either its equity or redeemable
preference shares in consideration of the Demer ger to each shareholder of the Company on a proportionate basis. The Scheme also provided
an option for the public shareholders to exchange equity shares of the Resulting Company for the listed shares in the Company held by the
Promoter Group. The Scheme is ef fective March 31, 2013 after receiving the sanction of the Honorable High Court and filing of the certified
copy of the Scheme with the Registrar of Companies.

In connection with the Demer ger, all subsidiaries which pertained to the Diversified Business were transferred to the Resulting
Company . Certain of these subsidiaries in turn possessed subsidiaries which do not pertain to the Diversified Business and instead are
considered a portion of the IT  Services business segment. Therefore, the Resulting Company is now in the process of completing the transfer
of the IT  Services related subsidiaries back to the Company . In the interim, the board of directors of the Resulting Company has authorized the
Company to retain all operating and management control for such subsidiaries, including the power to govern the operating and financial
policies, the appointing of a majority of the board of directors, and appointment of key management personnel.
Following the Ef fective Date, the Diversified Business is classified and presented in the consolidated financial statements as
discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. The Demer ger is
considered as a business under common control and hence is outside the scope of application of IFRS 3 and IFRIC 17. Accordingly , assets and
liabilities of the Diversified Business as on the Ef fective Date will be at their carrying values. Consequent upon giving ef fect to the Scheme of
Demer ger:.
 
 (i) The assets and liabilities of the demer ged undertaking have been transferred to the Resulting Company at their carrying amounts as
of the ef fective date;
 
 (ii) The carrying amount of net assets transferred pursuant to the Scheme has been accounted as under:
 
 a. The securities premium account has been reduced by Rs. 20,000 as per the court order; and
 
 b. The retained earnings has been reduced by the balance amount.
In January 2013, the Company acquired 100% share capital of L.D. Waxson (Singapore) Pte Limited and Hervil S.A. These
subsidiaries were transferred to the Resulting Company as part of the Diversified Business and are presented as part of the results from
discontinued operations. Since the Company intended to transfer these subsidiaries to the Resulting Company since the acquisition date, the
Company has adopted the single line method of consolidation for these subsidiaries.

Goodwill and indefinite life intangible were tested for impairment annually in accordance with the Company’ s procedure for
determining the recoverable value of such assets. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a CGU representing the
lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and which is not higher than the Group’ s
operating segment. The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of its FVLCTS and its VIU. The FVLCTS of the CGU is determined
based on the market capitalization approach, using the turnover and earnings multiples derived from observed market data. The VIU is
determined based on discounted cash flow projections. Key assumptions on which the Company has based its determination of VIUs include:
 
 a) Estimated cash flows for five years based on formal/approved internal management budgets with extrapolation for the remaining
period, wherever such budgets were shorter than 5 years period.
 
 b) Terminal value arrived by extrapolating last forecasted year cash flows to perpetuity using long-term growth rates. These long-term
growth rates take into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data. Such long-term growth rate considered does not
exceed that of the relevant business and industry sector .
 
 c) The discount rates used are based on the Company’ s weighted average cost of capital as an approximation of the weighted average
cost of capital of a comparable market participant, which are adjusted for specific country risks.
 
 d) Value-in-use is calculated using after tax assumptions. The use of after tax assumptions does not result in a value-in-use that is
materially dif ferent from the value-in-use that would result if the calculation was performed using before tax assumptions. The
before tax discount rate is determined based on the value-in-use derived from the use of after tax assumptions.
 
   Year ended Mar ch 31,
Assumptions   2012   2013
Terminal value long- term growth rate   3% - 6%   2% - 6%
After tax discount rate   10% - 16%   10% - 15.5%
Before tax discount rate   11.4% - 20.8%   11.7% - 23.1%
Based on the above, no impairment was identified as of March 31, 2012 and 2013 as the recoverable value of the CGUs exceeded the
carrying value. Further , none of the CGU’ s tested for impairment as of March 31, 2012 and 2013 were at risk of impairment. An analysis of
the calculation’ s sensitivity to a change in the key parameters (Revenue growth, operating mar gin, discount rate and long-term growth rate)
based on reasonably probable assumptions, did not identify any probable scenarios where the CGU’ s recoverable amount would fall below its
carrying amount.

Fair Value
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled revenues, trade payables, current financial liabilities and
borrowings approximate their carrying amount lar gely due to the short-term nature of these instruments. A substantial portion of the
Company’ s long-term debt has been contracted at floating rates of interest, which are reset at short intervals. Accordingly , the carrying value
of such long-term debt approximates fair value. Further , finance lease receivables are periodically evaluated based on individual credit
worthiness of customers. Based on this evaluation, the Company records allowance for expected losses on these receivables. As of March 31,
2012 and 2013, the carrying value of such receivables, net of allowances approximates the fair value.
Investments in liquid and short-term mutual funds, which are classified as available-for -sale are measured using quoted market prices
at the reporting date multiplied by the quantity held. Fair value of investments in certificate of deposits, classified as available for sale is
determined using observable market inputs.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined based on observable market inputs including currency spot and
forward rates, yield curves, currency volatility etc.
Fair value hierar chy
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2  – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability , either directly (i.e. as
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)

As at March 31, 2012 and 2013, there were no significant gains or losses on derivative transactions or portions thereof that have
become inef fective as hedges, or associated with an underlying exposure that did not occur .
Sale of financial assets
From time to time, in the normal course of business, the Company transfers accounts receivables, net investment in finance lease
receivables (financials assets) to banks. Under the terms of the arrangements, the Company surrenders control over the financial assets and
transfer is without recourse. Accordingly , such transfers are recorded as sale of financial assets. Gains and losses on sale of financial assets
without recourse are recorded at the time of sale based on the carrying value of the financial assets and fair value of servicing liability .
In certain cases, transfer of financial assets may be with recourse. Under arrangements with recourse, the Company is obligated to
repurchase the uncollected financial assets, subject to limits specified in the agreement with the banks. The Company has transferred trade
receivables with recourse obligation (credit risk) and accordingly , in such cases the amounts received are recorded as borrowings in the
statement of financial position and cash flows from financing activities. As at March 31, 2012 and 2013, the maximum amount of recourse
obligation in respect of the transferred financial assets (recorded as borrowings) is Rs. 1,163 and Nil, respectively .
Financial risk management
General
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a
financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange
rates, equity prices and other market changes that af fect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk
sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and borrowings.
The Company’ s exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating activities in
foreign currency . The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company’ s earnings and equity to losses.
Risk Management Pr ocedur es
The Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent control over
the entire process of market risk management. The corporate treasury department recommends risk management objectives and policies,
which are approved by senior management and the Audit Committee. The activities of this department include management of cash resources,
implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and
policies.
Foreign curr ency risk
The Company operates internationally and a major portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently the
Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales and services in the United States and elsewhere, and purchases from overseas
suppliers in various foreign currencies. The exchange rate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances,
forecasted cash flows, payables and foreign currency loans and borrowings. A significant portion of revenue is in U.S. dollars, euro and pound
sterling, while a significant portion of costs are in Indian rupees. The exchange rate between the rupee and U.S. dollar , euro and pound sterling
has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the rupee against these currencies can
adversely af fect the Company’ s results of operations.
The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters into foreign currency derivative
instruments to mitigate such exposure. The Company follows established risk management policies, including the use of derivatives like
foreign exchange forward / option contracts to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currency .
The Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedge to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure of
forecasted highly probable cash flows. The Company has also designated a combination of foreign currency borrowings and related cross-
currency swaps and other foreign currency derivative instruments as hedge of its net investment in foreign operations.

Inter est rate risk
Interest rate risk primarily arises from floating rate borrowing, including various revolving and other lines of credit. The Company’ s
investments are primarily in short-term investments, which do not expose it to significant interest rate risk. The Company manages its net
exposure to interest rate risk relating to borrowings, by balancing the proportion of fixed rate borrowing and floating rate borrowing in its total
borrowing portfolio. To manage this portfolio mix, the Company may enter into interest rate swap agreements, which allows the Company to
exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed upon fixed and floating interest rates. As of March 31, 2013, substantially
all of the Company borrowings was subject to floating interest rates, which reset at short intervals. If interest rates were to increase by 100 bps
from March 31, 2013, additional annual interest expense on the Company’ s floating rate borrowing would amount to approximately Rs. 496.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this, the
Company periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial condition, current economic trends,
analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly . No single customer accounted for
more than 10% of the accounts receivable as at March 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively and revenues for the year ended March 31, 201 1, 2012
and 2013, respectively . There is no significant concentration of credit risk.

Counterparty risk
Counterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market contracts and
credit risk on demand and time deposits. Issuer risk is minimized by only buying securities which are at least AA rated. Settlement and credit
risk is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions with counterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable
credit ratings. Exposure to these risks are closely monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters. There are limits on credit
exposure to any financial institution. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis including financial
statements and capital adequacy ratio reviews. In addition, net settlement agreements are contracted with significant counterparties.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
The Company’ s corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity , funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes
and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Company’ s net liquidity position through
rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows. As of March 31, 2012 and 2013, cash and cash equivalents are held with major banks and
financial institutions.

Deferred taxes on unrealized foreign exchange gain / loss relating to cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income
and presented within equity in the cash flow hedging reserve. Deferred tax liability on the intangible assets identified and recorded separately
at the time of an acquisition is recorded by an adjustment to goodwill. Other than these, the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is
primarily recorded in the statement of income.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the extent to which, it is probable that the deferred tax
asset will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the
periods in which those temporary dif ferences and tax loss carry-forwards become deductible. The Company considers the expected reversal of
deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on this, the Company
believes that it is probable that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible dif ferences. The amount of the deferred tax asset
considered realizable, however , could be reduced in the near term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are
reduced. Deferred tax asset in respect of unused tax losses amounting to Rs. 1,734 and Rs. 1,678 as at March 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively
have not been recognized by the Company .

The Company has recognized deferred tax assets of Rs. 2,330 and Rs. 3,526 in respect of carry forward losses of its various
subsidiaries as at March 31, 2012 and 2013. Management’ s projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies support the
assumption that it is probable that suf ficient taxable income will be available to utilize these deferred tax assets.
Pursuant to the changes in the Indian income tax laws, Minimum Alternate Tax (MA T) has been extended to income in respect of
which deduction is claimed under section 10A, 10B and 10AA  of the Act; consequently , the Company has calculated its tax liability for
current domestic taxes after considering MA T. The excess tax paid under MA T provisions over and above normal tax liability can be carried
forward and set-of f against future tax liabilities computed under normal tax provisions. The Company was required to pay MA T and
accordingly , a deferred tax asset of Rs. 1,223 and Rs. 1,842 has been recognized in the statement of financial position as of March 31, 2012
and 2013, respectively , which can be carried forward for a period of ten years from the year of recognition.
A substantial portion of the profits of the Company’ s India operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits attributable
to export operations and profits from undertakings situated in Software Technology , Hardware Technology Parks and Export Oriented units.
Under the tax holiday , the taxpayer can utilize an exemption from income taxes for a period of any ten consecutive years. The tax holidays on
all facilities under Software Technology , Hardware Technology Parks and Export oriented units has expired on March 31, 201 1. Additionally ,
under the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 scheme, units in designated special economic zones providing service on or after April 1, 2005
will be eligible for a deduction of 100 percent of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from
commencement of provision of services and 50 percent of such profits and gains for a further five years. Certain tax benefits are also available
for a further five years subject to the unit meeting defined conditions. Profits from certain other undertakings are also eligible for preferential
tax treatment. The tax holiday period being currently available to the Company expires in various years through fiscal 2026. The expiration
period of tax holiday for each unit within a SEZ is determined based on the number of years that have lapsed following year of
commencement of production by that unit. The impact of tax holidays has resulted in a decrease of current tax expense from our continuing
operations of Rs. 9,368, Rs. 7,953 and Rs. 9,244 for the years ended March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013 respectively , compared to the ef fective
tax amounts that we estimate we would have been required to pay if these incentives had not been available. The per share ef fect of these tax
incentives for the years ended March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013 was Rs. 3.84, Rs. 3.25 and Rs. 3.77 respectively .
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary dif ferences except in respect of taxable temporary dif ferences
associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary dif ference can be controlled and it is probable
that the temporary dif ference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Accordingly , deferred income tax liabilities on cumulative earnings of
subsidiaries amounting to Rs. 15,722 and Rs. 20,014 as of March 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively has not been recognized. Further , it is not
practicable to estimate the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for these undistributed earnings.
The tax loss carry-forwards of Rs. 5,344 and Rs. 5,566 as at March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013, respectively , relates to certain
subsidiaries on which deferred tax asset has not been recognized by the Company . Approximately , Rs. 4,417 and Rs. 4,596 as at March 31,
2012 and March 31, 2013, respectively , of these tax loss carry-forwards is not currently subject to expiration dates. The remaining tax loss
carry-forwards of approximately Rs. 928 and Rs. 970 as at March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013, respectively , expires in various years through
fiscal 2032.
The Company is subject to U.S. tax on income attributable to its permanent establishment in the United States due to operation of the
U.S. branch. In addition, the Company is subject to a 15% branch profit tax in the United States on the “dividend equivalent amount” as that
term is defined under U.S. tax law . The Company has not triggered the branch profit tax until year ended March 31, 2013. The Company
intends to maintain the current level of net assets in the United States commensurate with its operation and consistent with its business plan.
The Company does not intend to repatriate out of the Unites States any portion of its current profits. Accordingly , the Company did not record
current and deferred tax provision for branch profit tax.
 
20. Dividends
The Company declares and pays dividends in Indian rupees. According to the Indian law any dividend should be declared out of
accumulated distributable profits only after the transfer to a general reserve of a specified percentage of net profit computed in accordance
with current regulations.

The cash dividends paid per equity share were Rs. 8, Rs. 6 and Rs. 6 during the years ended March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013,
respectively , including an interim dividend of Rs. 2 for the years ended March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013.
During the year ended March 31, 201 1, the Company has also paid stock dividend, commonly known as bonus shares in India,
comprised of two equity shares for every three equity shares outstanding on the record date and two ADSs for every three ADSs outstanding
on the record date. The stock dividend did not af fect the ratio of ADSs to equity shares, such that each ADS after the stock dividend continues
to represent one equity share of par value of Rs. 2 per share.
The Board of Directors in their meeting on April 19, 2013 proposed a final dividend of Rs. 5 (US$0.09) per equity share and ADR.
The proposal is subject to the approval of shareholders at the ensuing Annual General Meeting of the shareholders, and if approved, would
result in a cash outflow of approximately Rs. 14,408, including corporate dividend tax thereon (Rs. 2,093).
 
21. Additional capital disclosur es
The key objective of the Company’ s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a stable capital structure with the focus on total
equity to uphold investor , creditor , and customer confidence and to ensure future development of its business. The Company focused on
keeping strong total equity base to ensure independence, security , as well as a high financial flexibility for potential future borrowings, if
required without impacting the risk profile of the Company .
The Company’ s goal is to continue to be able to return excess liquidity to shareholders by continuing to distribute annual dividends in
future periods. During the year ended March 31, 2012 and 2013, the Company distributed Rs. 4 as dividend per equity share. The Company
has also distributed an interim dividend of Rs. 2 per equity share during the year ended March 31, 2013. The amount of future dividends will
be balanced with ef forts to continue to maintain an adequate liquidity status.
The capital structure as of March 31, 2012 and 2013 was as follows:
 
   As at Mar ch 31,     
   2012   2013   %
Change  
Total equity attributable to the equity shareholders of the
Company   Rs.285,314    Rs.283,812     (0.53 )%

Current loans and borrowings    36,448     62,962

Total capital (loans and borr owings and equity)   Rs.344,272    Rs.347,628     0.97% 
          
The Company is predominantly equity-financed. This is also evident from the fact that loans and borrowings represented only 17%
and 18% of total capital as of March 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively . Further , the Company has consistently been a net cash company with
cash and bank balance along with available for sale investments being in excess of debt.

26. Earnings per  equity shar e
A reconciliation of profit for the year and equity shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per equity share is set
out below:
Basic: Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted
average number of equity shares outstanding during the period, excluding equity shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury
shares. Equity shares held by controlled Wipro Equity Reward Trust (‘WER T’) and Wipro Inc Benefit Trust (WIBT) have been reduced from
the equity shares outstanding for computing basic and diluted earnings per share. Earnings per share and number of shares outstanding for the
year ended March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013, have been adjusted for the grant of 1 employee stock option for every 8.25 employee stock option
held by each eligible employee in terms of the demer ger scheme as on the Record Date.

  2011   2012   2013  
Profit attributable to equity holders of the
Company  Rs. 52,977    Rs. 55,730    Rs. 66,359   
Weighted average number of equity shares
outstanding   2,437,492,921     2,449,777,457     2,453,218,759   
Basic earnings per share  Rs. 21.74    Rs. 22.76    Rs. 27.05   
Basic earnings per share from continuing
operations  Rs. 20.49    Rs. 21.36    Rs. 25.01   
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period for
assumed conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. Employee share options are dilutive potential equity shares for the Company .
The calculation is performed in respect of share options to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value
(determined as the average market price of the Company’ s shares during the period). The number of shares calculated as above is compared
with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

In May 2010, the Government of India amended the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 to increase the limit of gratuity payment from Rs.
0.35 to Rs. 1. Consequently , during the year ended March 31, 201 1, the Company has recognized Rs. 254 of vested past service cost in the
statement of income. Gratuity is applicable only to employees drawing a salary in Indian rupees and there are no other foreign defined benefit
gratuity plans.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of actuarial valuation are as follows:
 
   As at Mar ch 31,  
   2011  2012   2013

Expected return on plan assets    8%   8%   8% 
Expected rate of salary increase    5%   5%   5% 
The expected return on plan assets is based on expectation of the average long term rate of return expected on investments of the fund
during the estimated term of the obligations.
The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian government securities for the estimated term of the obligations.
Expected rate of return on plan assets based on the Company’ s expectation of the average long term rate of return expected on investments of
the Fund during the estimated term of the obligations. The estimates of future salary increases considered takes into account the inflation,
seniority , promotion and other relevant factors. Attrition rate considered is the management’ s estimate, based on previous years’  employee
turnover of the Company .

The experience adjustments, that is, the dif ference between changes in plan assets and obligations expected on the basis of actuarial
assumption and actual changes in those assets and obligations are as follows:
 
   As at Mar ch 31,  
   2011  2012   2013  
Difference between expected and actual developments:     
of fair value of the obligation   Rs.(32)  Rs.(147)  Rs.(58) 
of fair value of plan assets    15    52    44  
As at March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013, 100% of the plan assets were invested in insurer managed funds.
The expected future contribution and estimated future benefit payments from the fund are as follows:
 
Expected contribution to the fund during the year ending March 31, 2014   Rs. 428  
     
Estimated benefit payments from the fund for the year ending March 31:   
2014   Rs. 567  
2015    584  
2016    654  
2017    709  
2018    754  
Thereafter    3,352   
     
Total   Rs.6,620   
     
The expected benefits are based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company’ s benefit obligations as of March 31, 2013.
 
 c) Provident Fund:
Up to year ended March 31, 201 1, in the absence of guidance from the Actuarial Society of India, actuarial valuation could not have
been applied to reliably measure the provident fund liabilities. During the year ended March 31, 2012, the Actuarial Society of India issued the
guidance for measurement of provident fund liabilities. Accordingly , based on such actuarial valuation there is no shortfall in the fund as at
March 31, 2012.
The details of fund and plan assets are given below:
 
   As at Mar ch 31,  
   2009    2010    2011    2012    2013  
Fair value of plan assets   Rs.10,020     Rs.12,285     Rs.15,309     Rs.17,932     Rs.21,004   
Present value of defined benefit obligation    10,013      12,194      15,412      17,668      21,004   
     
     
     
     
     
Net (shortfall)/excess   Rs. 7    Rs. 91    Rs. (103)     Rs. 264    Rs. —    
     
     
     
     
     
The plan assets have been primarily invested in government securities.
The principal assumptions used in determining the present value obligation of interest guarantee under the deterministic approach are
as follows:
 
   As at Mar ch 31,  
   2009   2010   2011  2012   2013  
Discount rate for the term of the obligation   6.75%   7.15%   7.95%   8.35%   7.80%

considered a portion of the IT  Services business segment. Therefore, the Resulting Company is now in the process of completing the
transfer of the IT  Services related subsidiaries back to Wipro. In the interim, the board of directors of the Resulting Company has
authorized Wipro to retain all operating and management control for such subsidiaries, including the power to govern the operating and
financial policies, the appointing of a majority of the board of directors, and appointment of key management personnel, and
accordingly , the results of such subsidiaries are included with the results of the Company in these financial statements.

Details of contractual payments under non-cancelable leases are given below:
 
   As at Mar ch 31,  
   2012    2013  
Not later than one year   Rs.3,301     Rs.2,410

  Rs.14,839     Rs11,785   
     
     
Capital commitments: As at March 31, 2012 and 2013, the Company had committed to spend approximately Rs. 1,673 and Rs. 1,259,
respectively , under agreements to purchase property and equipment. These amounts are net of capital advances paid in respect of these
purchases.
Guarantees:  As at March 31, 2012 and 2013, performance and financial guarantees provided by banks on behalf of the Company to
the Indian Government, customers and certain other agencies amount to approximately Rs. 23,240 and Rs. 23,753, respectively , as part of the
bank line of credit.
Contingencies and lawsuits:  The Company had received tax demands aggregating to Rs. 39,356 (including interest of Rs. 12,170 )
arising primarily on account of denial of deduction under section 10A  of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in respect of profit earned by the
Company’ s undertaking in Software Technology Park at Bangalore for the years ended March 31, 2001 to March 31, 2008. The appeals filed
against the said demand before the Appellate authorities have been allowed in favor of the Company by the second appellate authority for the
years up to March 31, 2007. Further appeals have been filed by the Income tax authorities before the Honorable High Court. For the year
ended March 31, 2008, based on DRP  directions confirming the position of the assessing of ficer, the final assessment order was passed by the
assessing of ficer. The Company has filed an appeal against the said order before the Appellate Tribunal.
In March 2013, the Company received the draft assessment order , on similar grounds as that of earlier years, with a demand of Rs.
8,164 (including interest of Rs. 848) for the financial year ended March 31, 2009. The Company will file its objections against the said
demand before the Dispute Resolution Panel, within the time limit prescribed under the statute.
Considering the facts and nature of disallowance and the order of the appellate authority upholding the claims of the Company for
earlier years, the Company believes that the final outcome of the above disputes should be in favor of the Company and there should not be
any material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of its business. The resolution of
these legal proceedings is not likely to have a material and adverse ef fect on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company .
The Contingent liability in respect of disputed demands for excise duty , custom duty , income tax, sales tax and other matters amounts
to Rs. 1,472, Rs. 2,374 and Rs. 2,273 as of March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013, respectively .
Other commitments:  The Company’ s Indian operations have been established as unit in Special Economic Zone and Software
Technology Park Unit under plans formulated by the Government of India. As per the plan, the Company’ s India operations have export
obligations to the extent of foreign exchange net positive (i.e. foreign exchange inflow – foreign exchange outflow should be positive) over a
five year period. The consequence of not meeting this commitment in the future would be a retroactive levy of import duties on certain
hardware previously imported duty free. As of March 31, 2013, the Company has met all commitments required under the plan.
 
31. Segment Information
The Company is currently or ganized by segments, which includes the IT  Services (comprising of IT  Services and BPO Services), IT
Products, Consumer Care and Lighting and Others business segments. As of March 31, 2013, the Consumer Care and Lighting and Others

No client individually accounted for more than 10% of the revenues during the year ended March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013.
Management believes that it is currently not practicable to provide disclosure of assets by geographical location, as meaningful
segregation of the available information is onerous.
Notes:
 
a) The Company has the following reportable segments:
 
 i) IT Services: The IT  Services segment provides IT  and IT  enabled services to customers. Key service of fering includes software
application development, application maintenance, research and development services for hardware and software design, data
center outsourcing services and business process outsourcing services.
 
 ii) IT Products: The IT  Products segment sells a range of Wipro personal desktop computers, Wipro servers and Wipro notebooks. The
Company is also a value added reseller of desktops, servers, notebooks, storage products, networking solutions and packaged
software for leading international brands. In certain total outsourcing contracts of the IT  Services segment, the Company delivers
hardware, software products and other related deliverables. Revenue relating to these items is reported as revenue from the sale of
IT Products.
 
 iii) Consumer Care and Lighting: The Consumer Care and Lighting segment manufactures, distributes and sells personal care
products, baby care products, lighting products and hydrogenated cooking oils in the Indian and Asian markets. Ef fective
March 31, 2013, this segment represents discontinued operations, as discussed in Note 4.
 
 iv) The Others’  segment consists of business segments that do not meet the requirements individually for a reportable segment as
defined in IFRS 8. Ef fective March 31, 2013, this segment represents discontinued operations, as discussed in Note 4.
 
 v) Corporate activities such as treasury , legal and accounting, which do not qualify as operating segments under IFRS 8, and
elimination of inter -segment transactions have been considered within ‘reconciling items’.
 
b) Revenues include excise duty of Rs. 1,007, Rs. 1,205 and Rs. 1,377 for the year ended March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013, respectively . For
the purpose of segment reporting, the segment revenues are net of excise duty . Excise duty is reported in reconciling items.
 
c) For the purpose of segment reporting only , the Company has included the impact of ‘foreign exchange gains / (losses), net’  in revenues
(which is reported as a part of operating profit in the statement of income).
 
d) For evaluating performance of the individual business segments, stock compensation expense is allocated on the basis of straight line
amortization. The incremental impact of accelerated amortization of stock compensation expense over stock compensation expense
allocated to the individual business segments is reported in reconciling items.
 
e) For evaluating the performance of the individual business segments, amortization of intangibles acquired through business combinations
are reported in reconciling items.
 
f) For evaluating the performance of the individual business segments, loss on disposal of subsidiaries are reported in reconciling items.
 
g) The Company generally of fers multi-year payment terms in certain total outsourcing contracts. These payment terms primarily relate to
IT hardware, software and certain transformation services in outsourcing contracts. Corporate treasury provides internal financing to the
business units of fering multi-year payment terms. Accordingly , such receivables are reflected in capital employed in reconciling items.
As of March 31, 201 1, 2012 and 2013, capital employed in reconciling items includes Rs. 12,255, Rs. 13,562 and Rs. 14,123,
respectively , of such receivables on extended collection terms. The finance income on deferred consideration earned under these
contracts is included in the revenue of the respective segment and is eliminated under reconciling items.
